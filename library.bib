   * I wonder: Do I have to brainwash people into adopting a Rawlsian veil of ignorance? And if so: how could that be defended? My hunch: I can defend this because, inevitably, a prescription for the political process will entail an allocative prescription.
   * structure:
      * first do a qualitative analysis of elite thinking about tax. Do these people understand what they're talking about? Do they fall prey to some sort of social choice fuckup? (Miller!)
      * Is there a discourse theory thing to be said about elite thinking about tax?
      * Do the same thing that Miller does on page 64 about energy for tax.
      * Generally, use my MPP thesis as a survey of tax and a revised version of the desiderata for understanding the general issue.
      * here's what role the MPP thesis will play: isolate the dimensions of preferences in tax design. What trade-offs are out there? Once that is done, I can look at the discourse that I see as amalgams (This is Miller) or distortions of the trade-offs that are objectively out there.
         * next, I might see a disconnect.
         * finally, I run a deliberative poll to verify this.
   * Introduce a "Themenspeicher" for new ideas at the deliberation

Read Levi 1988

Scharpf (31) actually advocates consumption taxation, but he may have it a bit confused. Just moving to consumption tax doesn't help. It depends on which kind. A VAT, proportional consumption tax will actually still burden labor disproportionalte.

        
Scharpf also promotes (31) the negative income tax.

        
Figure out who cited Scharpf 1997.

Here's a very general point for my thesis: maybe something is missing from the political theory of the welfare state: can people understand this? Can they vote their preferences?
        
\%$\backslash$cite[212]\{Inglot2008\}: "Incompanson WIth continental Western Europe, East Central European countries have developed a spectrum of political forces that has clearly shifted in favor of market-liberal, nationalist, and conservative ideologies and policies of the political right" (Offe 1993, 671).
Offe might have missed something here, it's not just about the spectrum it's also about the understanding.
        
How is "paternalism" even a meaningful category to discuss this?
        
I think what is needed is a thoroughly political economy understanding of welfare state reform in post-communist countries.
        
Let's talk and think about the welfare state as if people mattered.
        
We can't do political science about this. We have to do political economy about this!
        
Just the "history matters" contention of Inglot doesn't serve us well. It's but another variant of TINA.
        
Don't worry, as Inglot does ibid: 300 about continuity and change, worry about the counterfactual.
        
There's no economic and/or sociological imagination (Mills) in any of this. Cite Mill, just for the heck of it.

@article{Sirgy-1998-aa,
abstract = {An attempt is made in this paper to establish a foundation for a theory of materialism and quality of life. The theory posits that overall life satisfaction (quality of life) is partly determined by satisfaction with standard of living. Satisfaction with standard of living, in turn, is determined by evaluations of one's actual standard of living compared to a set goal. Materialists experience greater dissatisfaction with their standard of living than nonmaterialists, which in turn spills over to overall life causing dissatisfaction with life in general. Materialists experience dissatisfaction with their standard of living because they set standard of living goals that are inflated and unrealistically high. These goals set by materialists are more influenced by affective-based expectations (such as ideal, deserved, and need-based expectations) than cognitive-based ones (such as predictive, past, and ability based expectations). Materialists' ideal standard-of-living expectations are influenced by social comparisons involving remote referents, more so than comparisons involving standards that are situationally imposed. Examples of situationally-imposed standards are perceptions of wealth, income, and material possessions of family, friends, neighbors, colleagues, and so on. In contrast, examples of standards based on remote sources are perceptions of standard of living of others in one's community, town, state, country, other countries; perceptions of standard of living of others based on gender, age, education, ethnicity, occupation, and social class. This tendency to use remote referents in social comparisons may account for materialists' inflated and value-laden expectations of their standard of living. Materialists' deserved standard-of-living expectations are influenced by the tendency to engage in equity comparisons involving income and work. Thus, materialists compare themselves with others that seem to have more income and worked no harder. These equity comparisons generate feelings of inequity, injustice, anger, or envy. These emotions may also account for materialists' inflated and value-laden expectations of their standard of living. Materialists' standard-of-living expectations based on minimum needs are influenced by the tendency to spend more than generate income. This proclivity to overconsume and underproduce may be partly responsible for materialists' inflated and value-laden expectations of their standard of living.},

Yes, I agree with these guys. It's not just about process.

        
There is some deep link between the nature of man and deliberation. I think they key is reciprocity, intersubjectivity and "social beings". We're deeply social, both in terms of our nature (psych), as well as in our politicel ecoomy.

        
Deliberation resolves, and requires this acceptance: it's about intersubjectivty. If you're a hyperliberal, you don't care about either of those.

        
Note in terms of substantive guarantees: "we hold these truths to be self-evident" (!)

abstract = {This article demonstrates that Axel Hadenius and Jan Teorell's attempt to disprove a causal effect of emancipative mass orientations on democracy is flawed in each of its three lines of reasoning. First, contrary to Hadenius and Teorell's claim that measures of ''effective democracy'' end up in meaningless confusion of democracy and minor aspects of its quality, we illustrate that additional qualifications of democracy illuminate meaningful differences in the effective practice of democracy. Second, Hadenius and Teorell's finding that emancipative orientations have no significant effect on subsequent measures of democracy from Freedom House is highly unstable: using only a slightly later measure of the dependent variable, the effect turns out to be highly significant. Third, we illustrate that these authors' analytical strategy is irrelevant to the study of democratization because the temporal specification they use misses almost all cases of democratization. We present a more conclusive model of democratization, analyzing how much a country moved toward or away from democracy as the dependent variable. The model shows that emancipative orientations had a strong effect on democratization during the most massive wave of democratization ever--stronger than any indicator of economic development. Finally, we illustrate a reason why this is so: emancipative orientations motivate emancipative social movements that aim at the attainment, sustenance, and extension of democratic freedoms.

abstract = {What is more important: to provide citizens with more money or with more autonomy for their subjective well-being? In the current meta-analysis, the authors examined national levels of well-being on the basis of lack of psychological health, anxiety, and stress measures. Data are available for 63 countries, with a total sample of 420,599 individuals. Using a 3-level variance-known model, the authors found that individualism was a consistently better predictor than wealth, after controlling for measurement, sample, and temporal variations. Despite some emerging nonlinear trends and interactions between wealth and individualism, the overall pattern strongly suggests that greater individualism is consistently associated with more well-being. Wealth may influence well-being only via its effect on individualism. Implications of the findings for well-being research and applications are outlined.},

Lieberman schl\"{a}gt vor, die Ans\"{a}tze zu kombinieren. Am historischen Beispiel des Wechsels von der „colour-blindness“ Politik zur „affirmative action“ in den USA der 60er und 70er kommt er zu dem Schluss „understanding puzzling change in American race policy lies at the intersection of ideas and institutions and in the tension between ideological traditions and institutional capacities.“
Kommentar: Der historische Fall ist plausibel erkl\"{a}rt. Der Vorteil des Beitrags liegt in der breiten Ber\"{u}cksichtigung der Literatur; dies geschieht aber weniger systematisch als in dem Beitrag von Campbell 1998. Der Nachteil darin, dass kein Analysemodell vorgeschlagen wird.

abstract = {A common thread weaving through the current public participation debate is the need for new approaches that emphasize two-way interaction between decision makers and the public as well as deliberation among participants. Increasingly complex decision making processes require a more informed citizenry that has weighed the evidence on the issue, discussed and debated potential decision options and arrived at a mutually agreed upon decision or at least one by which all parties can abide. We explore the recent fascination with deliberative methods for public involvement first by examining their origins within democratic theory, and then by focusing on the experiences with deliberative methods within the health sector. In doing so, we answer the following questions "What are deliberative methods and why have they become so popular? What are their potential contributions to the health sector?" We use this critical review of the literature as the basis for developing general principles that can be used to guide the design and evaluation of public involvement processes for the health-care sector in particular.},

@article{Freeman2000,
annote = {Note for thesis: Fishkin's is a procedural only view of deliberative democracy; there's no justice component, no common good component, no assumptions about how we're supposed to interact. I think that's fine, it's just not enough.
Why not make this bigger?

        
This is great text for the political philosophy implications of deliberation.

        
The aggregative view of democracy is much like a marketplace; it's the economics of poliical science.

        
I agree with Caplan that it's actually worse than a market, because it doesn't have prices, but only preferences and bare majority rule.

        

        
Bingo 375: "In contrast to this and other aggregative conceptions, the ideal of de- liberative democracy says that in voting it is the role, perhaps the duty, of democratic citizens to express their impartial judgments of what conduces to the common good of all citizens, and not their personal pref- erences based on judgments of how measures affect their individual or group interests"

        
Bingo377: here's the disagreement with Fishkin: " No reasonable conception of democracy would advise us to vote without thinking at all about how alternatives might affect relevant in- terests (whether our personal interests or the common interest). This would be irrational. In this regard what distinguishes deliberative from aggregative conceptions is not deliberation per se, nor the fact that one involves voting but the other does not (contrast Przeworski, DD2). Nor is it even that the deliberative view involves discussion while the aggregative view does not. "

        
There's also a more expansive list of other rights that deliberative democracy requires, including some basic economic and educational opportunities (see 381)

        

        
bingo 382, more etensive: all-purpose social means enable citizens to take advantage of their opportunities to participate in public life. (f) Citi- zens are individually free in that they have their own freely determined conceptions of the good, and these conceptions are publicly seen as le- gitimate even though they are independent of political purposes. More- over, (g) free citizens have diverse and incongruous conceptions of the good, which are constitutionally protected by basic rights. Because of this diversity (h) citizens recognize a duty in their public political delib- erations to cite public reasons-considerations that all reasonable citi- zens can accept in their capacity as democratic citizens-and to avoid public argument on the basis of reasons peculiar to their particular moral, religious, and philosophical views and incompatible with public reason. (i) What makes these reasons public is that they are related to and in some way advance the common interests of citizens. (j) Primary among the common interests of citizens are their freedom, independence, and equal civic status. 

        

        
I think there's really two groups of reasons for deliberation:

        
   * lack of information (cooperation problem, this is Kaplan) (this is the "Millian argument" as cited in ibid. 383
   * lack of cooperation in substantive terms (bare majority rule aint enough) (I find ibids definition on 383 too shorthand; it's not just about minority protection, it's about an awful lot more than that).
   * legitimacy (ibid 383) because people understand when they loose out, why the lose out
   * 4th: make principled arguments, "extends peoples imagination" (Goodin as cited ibid), "engages moral sentiments" (Rawls as cited ibid). "tempers self-interest" (Mill as cited ibid.)
   * 5th: autonomy by enlightenment: (sunstein as cited in bibid 384 "Political autonomy can be found in collective self-determination, as citizens decide, not what they 'want,' but instead who they are-what their values are and what those values require. "21 
ibid 388 calls this the difference between procedural and epistemic views of democracy.Procedural views emphasize fairness of demo- cratic procedures, whereas epistemic views emphasize substantive jus- tice of outcomes. A pure procedural conception of democracy has no standard independent of the voting procedure itself to determine the justice of outcomes.36 A pure epistemic conception says that justice is entirely independent of procedures for deciding what is just, so that the procedure that best approximates substantive justice is itself right (le- gitimate or just). 

        

        
ok: 401: "Rawls's ideal of public reason then responds to the "fact of reasonable pluralism." Reasonable pluralism-not pluralism per se-defines the pa- rameters and the reach of public reason. This means three things (at least). first, Rawls's idea of public reason does not rely on autonomy or any other "comprehensive" account of the human good; nor does it depend on an account of the origin of moral duty (in reason, emotion, or God's wis- dom or will.) The idea that autonomy, God, utility, human perfection, or some other comprehensive value, is a condition of justice and the hu- man good must be given up within public reasoning, for these values cannot provide bases for agreement on a common good among demo- cratic citizens "

        
There's hope for disagreeing, not tolerating stuff: 401: Rawls's ideal of public reason then responds to the "fact of reasonable pluralism." Reasonable pluralism-not pluralism per se-defines the pa- rameters and the reach of public reason. This means three things (at least). first, Rawls's idea of public reason does not rely on autonomy or any other "comprehensive" account of the human good; nor does it depend on an account of the origin of moral duty (in reason, emotion, or God's wis- dom or will.) The idea that autonomy, God, utility, human perfection, or some other comprehensive value, is a condition of justice and the hu- man good must be given up within public reasoning, for these values cannot provide bases for agreement on a common good among demo- cratic citizens 

        
402: "Whereas expression of such unreasonable views is to be tolerated, their effects are to be contained by society. There is no requirement that they be respected or accommo- dated by public reason "

        

        
I need some discussion on the complexities that are raised in this piece. Myabe I can tell Mathihs that I don't understand and/or care about them. Maybe I can argue that I don't need them because even absent such agreement, tax should look different. Tax is not a metaphysical question (or is it?)So here's the punch line (this needs to be argued very carefully): I think an economy, and in particular a democracy rooted in self-intersted are suboptimal and inequitable. Confer game theory. Argue this acrefully.

        

        

        
---

        
I think I need some sort of substantive justice yardstick, otherwise what with the guy who says I just don't care about other people? What with the guy who says I want no taxes? 
Just as deliberative democracy is an exercise in intersubjectivity, so must be the justice that underlies it. This is an axiomatic point, or maybe an anthropological one. Who we are as a species.
Maybe Rawls justice as fairness will work here?

abstract = {Despite major differences, prevailing approaches in democratization research have one thing in common: they downplay the role of mass attitudes. This article criticizes the neglect of mass attitudes, arguing that it ignores the very essence of democratization. In light of human development theory, democratization is essentially an emancipative process, for it manifests human freedom by empowering people with civil and political rights. From this premise, the author concludes that democratization should be driven by emancipative forces in the population and that these forces are reflected in particular mass attitudes: liberty aspirations. Based on evidence from the Values Surveys, the analyses show that more widespread liberty aspirations facilitate progress and impede regress in the process of democratization. No other indicator - including GDP/capita and social capital - outperforms the effect of liberty aspirations on democratization. The article concludes that human development theory is useful because its emphasis on people empowerment highlights something that has been ignored in the democratization literature: emancipative motivational forces in the population.

According to this assumption, the most appropriate policy strategy to improve equity in health is income redistribution. This paper considers reasons why tackling income inequality alone could be an inadequate approach to reducing differences in health across social classes and other population subgroups, and makes the case that universal social programs are critical to reducing inequities in health. A health system oriented around a strong primary care base is an example of such a strategy.},

(155).Because they’ll automatically redirect resources to wherever it will make the most money, irrespective of context or country. If it is PAYGO, that’s different, because more responsibility rests on the state to make the correct investment decisions (did I get this right?)This is it “PAYGO and funding are both financial mechanisms for organizing claims on that (future) output”This I like “Funded schemes are based on accumulations of financial assets, PAYG schemes on promises.” (157)},

annote = {   * 1779: economists usually say whatever the consumer says is right. So why not do this for positional consumption, too? There's ample evidence that consumption is, in fact, positional
   * 1782, on Coase: yes, indeed, externalities are not about perpetrators and victims, it's a mutual thing. We should worry:
      * can they deal with this themselves, are transaction costs sufficiently low and information sufficiently available?
      * which party can easier deal with the externality? Who can reduce it at a cheaper price? To systematically get at those parties who can, we make it a a) tax or b) a property right (Cap and trade)
   * 1783: the pct, as always, is an imperfect tax for getting at positional consumption, because it's hard to know which goods exactly are the most positional in nature. We can't just go and add tax labels. But luxuries are a good place to start with, steeply progressive pct will get most of what we're after
   * note: Frank suggests "context" as a key concept, with less normative baggage
      * mention this in email, too!
   * 1784: here's Frank's argument why the PCT is better at raising savings rates than an income tax:
      * To illustrate howthe taxwould change spending incentives, consider a taxpayer whose marginal rate under the current income tax is 0.33 and whose marginal rate under a progressive consumption tax would be rc. Under each tax regime, suppose that this taxpayer forgoes an extra dollar of consumption for the length of time it takes for money in a savings account to double in value. How much extra future consumption will his sacrifice support in each case? Under the current income tax, his dollar of forgone consumption generates a bank deposit of \$1, which becomes \$2 on the date in question. When he withdraws the \$2, he must pay \$0.33 in income tax on his one dollar of interest income. So \$1 of forgone consumption today translates into \$1.67 of future consumption under the current income tax. Under the consumption tax, by contrast, forgoing \$1 of consumption today would result in a \$ rc reduction in current tax liability, and so would support a current bank deposit of \$(1+rc). At withdrawal time, this deposit will have grown to \$(2+2rc). To find CF, the amount of future consumption this deposit will support, we solve CF+rcCF=\$(2+2rc) for CF=\$2. Giving up a dollar of current consumption thus supports only \$1.67 of future consumption under the current income tax, but \$2 under the progressive consumption tax.
   * 1784: consider the cascade effect of positional consumption which moves all the way from the top to the bottom
   * 1785: "My point in describing these examples is that limited empirical knowledge does not always prevent us from drawing reasonable inferences about the likely welfare effects of specific tax policy changes. Most economists would agree that the welfare cost to wealthy families of having smaller mansions and less expensive coming-of-age parties would be smaller than their benefit from having improved security. If so, the benefit of improved security to the non-wealthy would be pure gravy."
      * this is key; even if we can't model it entirely, this is a good way to look at it.

First, the ICD leads one to overlook values that serve both individual and collective interests. The ICD also ignores values that foster the goals of collectivities other than the ingroup. Finally, the ICD promotes the mistaken assumption that individualistic and collective values each form coherent syndromes that are in polar opposition. These problems are illustrated by applying a theory of universal value types to data from studies by M. Rokeach (1973), D. A. Ellerman et al (unpublished manuscript), H. C. Triandis et al (see record 1988-25273-001), and A. Uutela (1988). The analysis supported the criticisms and revealed group differences that are obscured by the ICD. Hypotheses are offered about the types of values likely to discriminate between societies with collectivist vs individualistic social structures.

For MPP: Schui seems to believe (19) when talking about the underconsumption crisis of late capitalism that we're already well beyond the steady state. This is the marx crisis over underconsumption, old style. Whether Schui is right or now (I don't think he is), he certainly is right that the balance between accumulation and consumption is a political call to be made.He says there are too stages: one in which surpluses are reliably consumed by investment goods, and that works out fine.
As the technology and investment goods reach diminishing returns, capital looks towards the production of consumption goods - but that, sadly is plagued by underconsumption.
There is ONE big problem: schui thinks about investment as non-human capital and as non-public. If you look at public goods, it's less clear that we have too little.
His is an exogenous growth theory.

        
This is the orthodox left. I disagree with them.

        
Write in the MPP why it matters a lot to think about exogenous vs. endogenous growth

        
The SChui problem, on a practical level: there is no meaningful way to steer the profit rate, because capitalists are no longer a class. (he wants to steer the profit rate on p. 33).

        
Schui also points out that in fact, there is a commons problem of growth and the profit rate, and he may be right about that: employers may prefer a low growth but high profit rate.

        

        
I disagree with Sinn's and other orthodox leftist views that distributional equity can only be reached under socialized industry (except, of course for public and common goods, there I agree, but that is not Sinn's point.) (40) It of course crucially hinges on the assumption that any monetarist policy would lead to more unemployment in the long run (false), rather than just its ableitung determining unemployment.

        
But Sinn has a point: "Abstraktion, das Denken n Systemen wurde durch das jeweils Unmittelbare, das Pragmatische ersetzt. Damit haben sich die sozialdemokratischen Parteien Zug um Zug desavouirt." (41) he is right about that.

        
Note: discounting of the future may be a commons problem because of the savings rate that is included.
schui has and hes right characterized homo economicus as a culturel feehlleistung with consequences 108

        
for the hertie critique: lack of abstraction makes latently affirmative: read again SChui 138ff. the systemic is missing. Great quote on 140.

        
Grundrente IS a problem indeed. it shuld be taxed or socialized (this amogst other reasons was a reaon for sozialen wohnungsbau, an originaally market and consevative idea because no one should gain without work (156)

        
---
For the offe/kuhnle paper. Schui 147 is right to point out that minimizing the problems of old age insurance to demographic change is latently affirmative: it distracts us from the possibility to redistribute the fruits of productivity gains.But then again, I also think that Schui is scandalously simplifying matters - its really much more difficult.same logic applies to trade: the chinese and eastern europeans arent self evident... schui 148},

Bingo:

        
‘The freedoms of speech and association not only provide the guarantee of a more extensive political activity than the vote; ‘The freedoms of speech and association not only provide the guarantee of a more extensive political activity than the vote;

        
53: At its heart, a deliberative polity promotes political dialogue aimed at mutual understanding, which ‘does not mean that people will agree, but rather that they are motivated to resolve conflicts by argument rather than other means’.17 Hence, what is fundamental to democratic dialogue is ‘deliberative’ as opposed to ‘strategic’ or ‘instrumental’ rationality.

        
Bingo!

        

        
apparently, Bohman said in 2000 that "there was still a surprising lack of empirical case studies of democratic deliberation at the appropriate level and sclae" (ibid: 55).

        
Don't do "representativeness": (56):  However, there are
both conceptual and practical problems with this account of representation. First,
no selected jury can accurately mirror all the standpoints and views present in
the wider community.54 Secondly, there is a danger of creating false essentialisms.
Are, for example, women jurors expected to represent all women in the wider
community, elderly jurors, all other elderly citizens

        

        
The question of size is key: (59)
We have already raised a concern that the small size of one-off juries (as in the USA
and UK) limits the range of different perspectives and experiences that citizens
can draw on. However, the small size of the jury and the time that jurors spend
together both appear important for enhancing the deliberative quality of the process.
An environment is created where stable expectations and relations of trust
can be fostered between participants, so essential for mutual understanding.72
Dynamics of large assemblies tend to differ markedly. As Elster argues: ‘In a large
assembly, it is not possible to pursue an argument in a coherent and systematic
fashion. The debates tend to be dominated by a small number of skilled and charismatic
speakers \ldots who count on rhetoric rather than argument’. In comparison, in
a small jury setting, ‘one is more likely to observe the substance and not only the
form of deliberation. The small size reduces the scope for demagogy and allows all
speakers to be heard’.73 Suspicion of strategic action on the part of citizens is also
lessened given that the jury process ‘does not represent an opportunity for advancement,
promotion or re-election’ for those involved.74
This ‘face-to-face’ interaction of jurors, made possible by the small number of
participants, is often celebrated: ‘The face-to-face nature of debates is seen as a way
of drawing people into the political process, enabling them to think not as isolated,
anonymous individuals, but as citizens, working together via dialogue and consensus
for the “common good” of society’.75 However it is important to remember
Mansbridge’s warning: ‘In moments of genuine conflict, face-to-face contact among
citizens encourages suppression of that conflict’. There may well be ‘face-to-face
temptations to false unanimity’,76 but unlike the small-town meetings that Mansbridge
has analysed, in juries there are marked differences between participants
which lessens the pressure to conform.77

A central question is the degree to which these associations reflect a causal association. If so, redistribution of income would improve health. This paper discusses two ways in which income could be causally related to health: through a direct effect on the material conditions necessary for biological survival, and through an effect on social participation and opportunity to control life circumstances. The fewer goods and services are provided publicly by the community, the more important individual income is for health. Under present U.S. circumstances, a policy of counteracting growing income inequalities through the tax and benefit system and of public provision appears justified.},

@book{AbrahamHamilton-2006-aa,
address = {Washington, D.C.},
annote = {In the following, I take issue with the policy proposals brought forward by Abraham et al. (2006). The generally pro-immigration stance of the policy proposal is well argued, supported by well-explained economic and demographic arguments, which are likely to be most enticing for policy makers and voters. I do however find that surprisingly little is said about the “quality” of immigration, despite the title “the immigration America needs” and somewhat alarmist reports on increasing tertiary education in India and China. Exactly how such selection is supposed to work, if at all, remains dubious. More generally, but related, I find that the proposal places to much attention on what happens after immigration; incorporation, in particular possible responsibilities the state could or should take in this process, are treated only very briefly. Clearly, the proposal does not include anything but a moderating and informing role for the state in guiding and encouraging incorporation, much in contrast to the Canadian model as reported by Bloemraad (2006). The fundamental laiss\'{e}z-faire attitude of American policies towards incorporation is maybe nicely shown in the praising of essentially American values of “freedom, opportunity, individual rights and the rule of law” (xv). Particularly changes in the field of education, to my mind, are conspicuously absent from the present proposal: when new generations of immigrants are supposed to secure the United States’ position in the international knowledge economy and immigrants are not necessarily well educated when they arrive, education becomes a topic for immigration policy, too.  I also find the treatment of immigration as regional policy somewhat superficial, and largely confined to border control cooperation. A truly multilateral or regional perspective in the spirit of “the United States prosper when its neighbors prosper (18), is, in fact, missing. While an abstract lip-service to development in Mexico is paid, we learn little about which (if any?) active role the US could play in that. At the same time it is obvious that US immigration policy, especially when trying to attract highly educated immigrants, may be very problematic for the further development of the Mexican economy. Here, a truly regional perspective should have envisioned an immigration policy that balances the needs of both economies, rather than only the need of the US economy.  I very much appreciate the criticism of “enforcement only” approaches (such as the 1995 House Bill) that the proposal explains.},

abstract = {This paper examines self-reported health among individuals in 21 European countries. The purpose is to analyze how both individual- and country-level characteristics influence health. The study is based on data from the European Social Survey (ESS) conducted in 2003 and employs hierarchical modelling (N=38,472). We present three main findings: (1) individual-level characteristics, such as age, education, economic satisfaction, social network, unemployment, and occupational status are related to the health of individuals, both for women and men; (2) we tested how societal features, such as public expenditure on health, socioeconomic development, lifestyle, and social capital (social trust) were related to subjective health. Among the country-level characteristics, socioeconomic development, measured as GDP per capita (logarithm), is the indicator that is most strongly associated with better health, after controlling for individual-level characteristics; (3) the eastern European countries stand out as the countries where individuals report the poorest health. In our models, the individual-level variables explain 60\% of the variance between countries, whereas 40\% is explained by the macro-level variables.},

* There are inflows (from yet cheaper countries) and outflows, but the net is outflow
* note that unambigously, the income levels have converged as part of the mobility (40 to 63 of EU average in just 7 years, that is in baltic economies)
* note that the overall dynamic important here is the one from tradables to nontradables and back
* they show that for convergence, labor migration is better than none. Ok, I get that. But maybe, that is because we take capital mobility for granted. The status quo still stands.
* and it is, of course, blind to distributional effects over a social gradient or education
* There is support for factor price problems: "In Estonia, for example, net wages for those with tertiary education were 93 percent higher in 1997 than for those with only primary education; by 2006, this premium had fallen to 32 percent" (33), in a section oddly titled "reducing labor market mismatches"

cites dahl (nice): "and engage in debate and discussion.
“In these ways,” Dahl writes, “the democratic process could be adapted once again

        
to a world that little resembles the world in which democratic ideas and practices

        
first came to life.”4 Technology"

        

        

        

        

        
Overview of what's out there in terms of formats:

        

        
   * Deliberative Polls (US / Fishkin)
   * Citizen Juries (US, abroad)
   * Planning Cells (Germany)
   * Consensus Conferences (Denmark)
      * are, says ibid, typically run together with media outlets (!) who publish the poll results
      * I think I also want a written document.
   * AmericaSpeaks, 21st Century Town Hall Meetings
   * National Issues Forum

        

        
Generally, note the Rawlsian, or theory-driven case selection (saturation sampling) backup to representativenss. It's not about aggregation.

        

        

        

        

        

        

        
Here are list of impacts that Deliberation may have on the public:

        
Impact may come in the form of actually making policy, being
taken up in the policy process, informing public debates, market-testing of proposals,
legitimation of public policies, building confidence and constituencies for policies,
popular oversight, and resisting co-option.

@book{Motomura-2006-aa,
annote = {Reading: Motomura 2006. In the following, I discuss Motomura’s (2006) proposal to treat permanent legal residents as „Americans in Waiting“, according them (almost) full citizenship privileges during their first five years of stay in the US at which point they either have to naturalize or revert back to “normal” (non-privileged) permanent legal resident status. Most importantly, I find Motomura’s suggestion very helpful because it increases the incentives to assimilate, broadly speaking in Alba and Nee’s (2003) terms. Straightforwardly, this will make assimilation much smoother and it will reduce some of the costs associated with integration, particularly the insecurities (for example, as Motomura describes, which benefits immigrants are eligible and so forth) as non-citizens. The importance of political participation can also be hardly overstated. Together with a more active settlement assistance and more public support for local community initiatives (Brubaker 2001), early voting rights could jump-start a civic immigrant society with well documented beneficial effects both for local government (Putnam 1993) as well as immigrant economic attainment (Inglehart) and increased social cohesion and assimilation. While Motomura’s focus on different legal regimes certainly is somewhat limited and as a policy proposal needs to complemented by other aspects, the stress on citizenship is not without merits. Like Motomura, I strongly disagree with those who believe that citizenship, in the age of putative “postnational models” has become irrelevant. First of all, empirically, this makes little sense. In the absence of any non-statebound welfare schemes (maybe with the exception of the sui genesis EU), it seems likely that national citizenship will continue to be a significant social marker if only to mark access rights to (national) welfare schemes. Also, I do see the danger of alternative group markers, such as religion, race, class and other groupings to take the place of citizenship. The proponents of a post-national era should not mistake this scenario as particularly cosmopolitan; much rather, societies might become increasingly atomistic, and made up of “thousand petty fortresses” to cite political philosopher Micahel Walzer (as cited in Motomura 2006: 13). The danger lies here in the decreased potential for (political) cooperation. All the problems of the nation state notwithstanding, it, and with it, national citizenship, provides institutions that foster (rather: force) cross-cutting cooperation between multiple groups, precisely because the state, in a transnational era, is such a “random” socially constructed entity with little of the original “nation”-part of the definition left. Motomura’s contribution is to understand this as an advantage of national citizenship, rather than a disadvantage.},

Second, public opinion in mass society may be open to manipulation because of the public's low information levels. If people have little background information, then foregrounding particular facts may be persuasive when people have no idea of the broader context. Clean coal advocates make a powerful case for the benefits of clean coal compared to dirty coal, but the mass public has little idea that clean coal is much dirtier than natural gas (as well as other alternatives like renewable energy). Selective invocation of true facts (such as that clean coal is cleaner than dirty coal) without a context where those facts can be compared to others (how clean coal compares to other energy alternatives) can allow advocates to manipulate opinion.10 Third, when people have little information they may easily fall prey to misinformation. Even when contrary information was in the public domain, assertions that Iraq was responsible for 9/11 apparently carried weight when it was shrouded in the protective glare of national security. Fourth, a strategy of manipulation that is probably more common than misinformation is strategically incomplete but misleading information. If one argument based on true but misleadingly incomplete information has high visibility through expensive advertising and the counter to it never gets an effective audience, then the public can be seriously misled. Fifth, another key strategy of manipulation is to "prime" one aspect of a policy, making that dimension so salient that it overwhelms other considerations. In effect, a candidate or policy advocate changes the terms of evaluation so that the issue on which his or her side does best becomes the one that is decisive.11 Read more at location 124   • Delete this highlightNote: these are the dysfunctions of liberal democracy; given its limitations.

By priming a dimension, whether crime or character or national security, the incident can be intentionally employed to change (or further emphasize) the terms of evaluation to the neglect of other issues.12 As campaigns (and outside actors) compete to reshape the playing field, the result is literally MAD or what might be termed mutually assured distraction.

Our US system began with an aspiration for deliberation-for representatives to "refine and enlarge" or "filter" the public voice, as James Madison theorized. But the technology of the persuasion industry has made it possible for elites to shape opinion and then invoke those opinions in the name of democracy. Techniques of persuasion tested in focus groups and measured by people meters have been developed for commercial purposes to sell us products ranging from detergents to automobiles. The same techniques are routinely employed to sell candidates and policies or to mobilize or demobilize voting. As our political process is colonized by the persuasion industry, as our public dialogue is voiced increasingly in advertising, our system has undertaken a long journey from Madison to Madison Avenue.

The production of informed, considered opinions for politics and policy is a public good. And the logic of collective action for public goods dictates that motivating large numbers to produce a public good requires selective incentives (incentives that apply just to those who produce them) otherwise there will be a failure to provide them." Barring some transformation of preferences in which people valued forming informed and considered judgments for its own sake (maybe after some transformative form of civic education") there is every reason to believe that a large-scale public opinion with the limitations just sketched will be the norm.

For those issues, the relevant issue publics may in fact become well informed. If I do not care about farm policy I can just leave it to the farmers (or so the argument goes). But from the standpoint of democratic theory, the worry is that farmers have special interests. And all the other issue publics have their own distinct interests and values. To what extent do we want to delegate policy to the relevant issue publics? As Robert Dahl noted years ago, leaving policy to those especially interested leads to a pattern not of majority rule but of "minorities rule.i22 WhileRead more at location 190   • Delete this highlightAdd a note

In our democratic experience thus far, the design (and possible reform) of democratic processes has confronted a recurring choice between institutions, on the one hand, that express what the public actually thinks but usually under debilitated conditions for it to think about the issues in question, as contrasted with institutions, on the other hand, that express more deliberative public opinion-what the public would think about an issue if it were to experience better conditions for thinking about it.

Of course, democratic institutions typically will offer a mix of deliberative and mass democracy, a mix of the filter and the mirror, but over the last two centuries of democratic experience in America (and indeed in most developed democracies) the balance has shifted toward far greater mass influence in the mix-far greater deference toward raw public opinion (as opposed to refined or more deliberative views).

The idea is that if a counterfactual situation is morally relevant, why not do a serious social science experiment-rather than merely engage in informal inference or armchair empiricism-to determine what the appropriate counterfactual situation might actually look like? And if that counterfactual situation is both discoverable and normatively relevant, why not then let the rest of the world know about it? Just as John Rawls's original position can be thought of as having a kind of recommending force, the counterfactual representation of public opinion identified by the Deliberative Poll also recommends to the rest of the population some conclusions that they ought to take seriously.57 TheyRead more at location 447   • Delete this highlightNote: bingo.

From this perspective we have three core values, not just the two discussed so far-political equality, deliberation, and mass participation. Why not attempt to achieve all three? If one is aspiring to achieve inclusion, political equality would seem important since it requires inclusion on an equal basis-equal counting of ones' views. But the equal counting is not explicitly linked to individual behavior. For that reason it does not seem to be a proxy for any kind of actual mass consent. If I do not participate, but am rather one of the people who had a random chance of being chosen, there is a sense in which I do not individually feel included. The indications of inclusion, while perhaps as effective as from actual mass participation, are nevertheless not very tangible.

We can talk about the quality of a deliberative process in terms of five conditions: a. Information: The extent to which participants are given access to reasonably accurate information that they believe to be relevant to the issue b. Substantive balance: The extent to which arguments offered by one side or from one perspective are answered by considerations offered by those who hold other perspectives c. Diversity: The extent to which the major positions in the public are represented by participants in the discussion d.

The reason for maintaining random sampling is that the key claim of the DP, and indeed, as we shall see, the key claim of deliberative democracy more generally, is the simultaneous realization of deliberation and political equality.

While this has not yet been studied systematically,11 consider that when we did a national DP in the 1997 British General Election there was an extraordinary rise in the support for the third party, the Liberal Democrats. Some pundits suggested that when it came to the real vote, the DP supporters would not actually vote Lib Dem as they would be under pressure to vote for one of the two parties that had a better chance of winning. Yet when we went back to respondents right after the election, their self-reports of how they voted corresponded almost perfectly to the final DP results.12 TheirRead more at location 623   • Delete this highlightNote: this is great evidence.

Note that in terms of having an equal chance of being the decisive voter, there is no difference in the root notion of political equality whether (a) all voters vote and those votes are counted equally so that I have an equal chance of being the decisive voter or (b) there is a lottery among all voters to select a microcosm and the microcosm votes and those votes are then counted equally.

This problem-that there is little rational motivation for citizens to deliberate about public issues in mass democracies-does not depend on citizens being selfish or merely self-interested. Even if citizens have altruistic or ethical reasons for valuing the provision of a public good to everyone, even if they are valuing alternatives, not merely for their effects on their own well-being, but rather for their effects on the whole society, they still can face this problem. As Mancur Olson showed years ago, there is a general problem motivating individual participation in collective action intended to bring about the provision of public goods where the groups involved are large and the individual effect on the provision of the public good is small."

However, even this picture is too optimistic, as it seriously overstates the degree to which familiar institutions that attempt to realize participatory equality succeed in doing so. Our pursuit of participatory equality has been seriously flawed, even in terms of the two values it has focused on, participation and equality. Our actual practices of political participation suffer from "participatory distortion"-the people who choose to participate are unrepresentative of the entire electorate.23 In the United States, those who actually participate are generally more white, more prosperous, and more educated by far than those who do not. In that sense, effective political equality has been achieved far less than the breakdown of formal barriers to participation (in terms of voting rights) would suggest.

The idea of microcosmic deliberation is to take a relatively small, face-to-face group which everyone has an equal chance of being part of, and provide it with good conditions for deliberating on some policy or political issue. Citizens Juries, like Deliberative Polls use public opinion research methods to gather a sample to deliberate. But the Citizens Jury is more akin to a single discussion group in that the size is comparable to that of a modern jury-twelve or perhaps eighteen or twenty-four.34 A benefit of such a group is that it can continue to meet in a local community for an extended period, sometimes for several days or on successive weekends. The "jurors" hear testimony, call witnesses, ask for evidence, and at some point come up with recommendations to some local or governmental authority. The limitation of the process is that with such small numbers it is not possible to establish the statistical representativeness of the deliberating group. Citizens juries are too small for there to be a scientific basis for connecting their conclusions to the counterfactual informed opinion of an entire society, to what the country would decide if it were better informed-even though the results of Citizens juries are often represented in that way. However, the now extensive experience in both the United States and the United Kingdom with Citizens juries adds to our picture of citizen competence with complex policy issues-once citizens find themselves in a social context that supports deliberation.35 Read more at location 843   • Delete this highlightNote: if I can't get enough money for a deliberative poll, I'll do a "Citizen Jury" Edit this note

In both Schumpeter's view and Richard Posner's recent revival of the argument, the idea is to contrast some "classical" theory that aspired to public will formation and a modern competitive view which made no such claims. While there are issues about what exactly the classical theory is that poses the alternative, the basic idea is to build on the contrast between public will formation and a simple decision about who wins the electoral game to achieve and hold office.' Posner treats the contrasting deliberative model of democracy as a kind of illusory ideal. He dismisses it "as a pipe dream hardly worth the attention of a serious person." Focusing on citizen deliberation as a way of improving democracy, he says, would be like asking Odysseus to sprout wings as a way of leaving Calypso's island. What makes deliberation unattainable, in his view, is the inability of citizens to deal with complex policy issues.' Thus democratic reforms should focus simply on improving the conditions for party competition. Of course, whether or not ordinary citizens (or voters or residents) are indeed capable of dealing with complex policy issues is an empirical question-one that the Deliberative Polling initiative, along with many other efforts, is devoted to exploring.?

The extensive discussion of Federalist No. 10 has been dominated by the second of two arguments he offers in response to this problem. The second argument is a justly famous one: [E]xtend the sphere and you take in a greater variety of parties and interests; you make it less probable that a majority of the whole will have a common motive to invade the rights of other citizens; or if such a common motive exists, it will be more difficult for those who feel it to discover their own strength and to act in unison with each other. But this argument is about how majority factions are less likely to form in large states, or, if they form, how they are less likely to make themselves felt. It does not deal explicitly with the apparent incompatibility between the "republican principle" itself and the principle that majority factions adverse to the rights of others should not carry the day (how to satisfy what we are calling the non-tyranny condition).

So-called deliberative democracy may simply reflect the intellectual hegemony of the more educated and more advantaged. It does not make a serious moral claim.

To assess this argument first, consider the initial move-the often discussed division of democratic theories into two broad categories-aggregative and deliberative. I believe such a division only tells part of the story. Deliberation is a condition of preference formation. Aggregation by majority rule or other voting rules is a property of the decision rule by which those preferences, however produced, culminate in some kind of conclusion or decision.

This way of dividing up the terrain is different from our basic classification of four democratic theories. Competitive democracy will usually fit within III as it is just a matter of aggregating raw preferences to find out which team wins. Mass participatory democracy aspires to Category I but usually will fall into III, since the mass public usually has relatively raw and uninformed preferences. Elite deliberation will sometimes fit under II, when a real consensus is achieved in a committee meeting for example. But it will often fall in I, as when members of the Senate agree to disagree and end up taking a vote. Consensual decision with raw preferences, IV, does not correspond to one of the four normative theories discussed here, but as noted could be realized by a brainwashing consensus.

Of course, whether online or face-to-face, a population can be subdivided, as with our Deliberation Day proposal, envisioning many small groups.

Our other focus for how to fill out Quadrant II, microcosmic deliberation, is a very old practice, but one that has only recently revived. If it is to acquire credibility, it needs buttressing with systematic investigation. Social science can be employed to give credibility to the claim that a particular strategy of institutional design has been realized to give expression to deliberative democracy-to the combination of political equality and deliberation. The aspiration is to undertake a research agenda that credibly explores the conditions under which deliberation might be realized by ordinary citizens who constitute a credible microcosm. The tighter this connection, the more transparent it is; the more evidence there is that it has been achieved without distortion, the more force there is to the claim that we can accept a realization of what the people would think (Quadrant II), rather than what they actually do think when they are not thinking very much (Quadrant IV).

First, if and when this combination is achieved, how inclusive is it? In what way can it represent all the relevant voices or perspectives in the population? Second, if and when this combination is achieved, how thoughtful is it? We need to look at specific indicators of deliberative quality to evaluate the process and ensure that the results really are driven by consideration of the merits of competing arguments and not distorted by some pattern of domination or group psychology. Third, if and when this combination is achieved, what effects does it have? What effects does it have on participants or on the broader public dialogue?

The problem is that any microcosmic deliberation taking place in a modern developed society will be one in which there are significant social and economic inequalities in the conduct of ordinary life in the broader society. It seems difficult or impossible to "bracket" these inequalities-for participants to behave "as if" they do not exist.6 Indeed the problem goes deeper. The possibility of doing so is the challenge of the "autonomy of the political," namely, whether or not equality can hold sway in politics in a world in which inequality rules in economic and social relations. The viability and legitimacy of the liberal-democratic project may turn on the answer. HowRead more at location 1431   • Delete this highlightNote: bingo. This is indeed the huge question.

But Young's point is that there are more subtle forms of exclusion that turn on manners of speaking and listening. Some people, even if formally included, may not have their voices, if they speak at all, taken seriously. They may give off cues that indicate they are not well informed or not worth listening to. Those who are accustomed to every advantage in the conduct of their everyday lives may be more assertive in pressing their views on others and less open to listening to those without similar advantages.' They may also be more accustomed to orderly forms of reason-giving argument that weigh with other participants. Or so the argument goes.

Cass Sunstein, building on earlier work on the so-called risky shift has claimed there is an inevitable "law of group polarization."

Changes in policy attitudes. The ultimate questions in a deliberative public consultation focus on "what is to be done?" Hence policy attitudes supporting (or opposing) one policy alternative or another are central. Are these the same or different as those from conventional, usually "top of the head" polls?" b. Changes in voting intention. Some deliberative consultations take place in the context of an election or referendum. The question "what is to be done?" comes down to the personal level of one's vote. c. Changes in civic capacities. Here I refer to changes in attributes at the individual level that may contribute to public problem-solving. I will include information, efficacy, public spiritedness, and political participation. First, consider information. One of our indicators of quality in deliberation is that the participants become more informed. Rather than self-reports about whether or not people think they are well informed we ask questions that, unlike those about the empirical premises above, have uncontested correct answers.

Consider efficacy. Will discussion of public problems together under conditions of good information and, potentially, conditions of empowerment increase the sense of political efficacy of those who take part? Will it affect their internal efficacy, their sense that they can have an impact on the political or policy process as a result of their own efforts? Or will it affect their sense of external efficacy, their sense that government will be responsive to their concerns? These issues can be explored by before and after questions and, where possible, questions to control groups as well. As for public spiritedness, there is a long-standing hypothesis speculated about by Alexis de Tocqueville in his writings about America and by John Stuart Mill, who was partly responding to those writings, that when citizens discuss public problems together they come to place greater value upon the interests of the broader community. There are two versions of the hypothesis-the community whose interests they value is enlarged and the degree to which they value that community's interests is increased. As shorthand, we can refer to either one as an increase in "public spiritedness." As for political participation, once citizens are actively engaged in the discussion of politics or policy, particularly if it is in a context where they feel their voice matters, they may wish to continue engagement. And some of the other factors potentially affected by deliberation, efficacy, and information, may also contribute to their further participation. d.Read more at location 1471   • Delete this highlightAdd a note
        
        
Changes in collective consistency. The literature on public choice, from the Marquis de Condorcet in the eighteenth century through William H. Riker, Kenneth Arrow, and modern practitioners confronts the problem that democracy can lead to cycles. In pairwise comparisons majorities can move from A to B to C and back to A again. When this is the case, agenda manipulations can arbitrarily determine the outcome. Any claims to a reasoned public will formation seem undermined. However, when preferences conform to an underlying dimension, say left-right as an example, then they are said to be "single peaked" and cycles are not possible.12 There has been considerable speculation that when participants deliberate together, the percentage of the participants who come to share the same single-peaked dimensions increases, making cycles less likely or virtuallyRead more at location 1479   • Delete this highlightNote: this is my stuff.

If this should be the case, then that would show that deliberation helps democracy achieve a collective consistency or coherence that a democracy of "top of the head" opinions can possibly lack. We say "collective consistency" because single-peakedness, while inferable from the preferences of individuals, is a collective property, one that refers to the preference structure of a given group or population that will be doing the voting.Read more at location 1485   • Delete this highlightAdd a note
        
        
Changes in the public dialogue. Many exercises in deliberative democracy receive substantial media attention. When coverage is keyed to the public's deliberative processes, is it different from say the horse race coverage of campaigns or the coverage of policy through a partisan filter on cable news or talk radio? What does it contribute that may be distinctive? f. Changes in public policy. As we have emphasized, a key to the success of microcosmic deliberation is that the participants believe their voices matter in some way. They overcome inattention and disconnection by a situation that by its very structure undermines any calculations of rational ignorance. They each have one voice in a small group of fifteen (as well as one questionnaire in a gathering of a few hundred at most). What they say and think matters to their self-presentation in a small face-to-face group. In addition, it may seem consequential because it will get media coverage. But finally, they may hope or believe it may have an influence on policy. To what extent is this latter aspiration realistic? Do deliberative microcosms sometimes have an effect on policy?

To fix ideas consider the practice of Deliberative Polls to pay incentives. The first Deliberative Poll, about the issue of crime in Britain, offered a financial incentive of a modest fifty British pounds in addition to rail or bus transportation, hotels, and meals. The National Issues Convention paid each participant \$300 as a gesture of appreciation, plus free air fare, hotels, and meals. In addition, these events, like most Deliberative Polls, were televised. Some of the participants were undoubtedly attracted by the idea of participating in a national public dialogue. But others were attracted by the incentive or by the idea of a free trip to an interesting place. Special efforts had to be made to facilitate participation for those with special problems. We called employers to try and get permission for participants to take time off from work. One woman had a small farm and there was no one to milk her cow.

By contrast, we can more confidently generalize from a design where the total number of participants is large enough to be evaluated statistically, and where there are comparisons between participants and nonparticipants about their views on first contact, before they start changing in anticipation of the event.

abstract = {Current democratic theory and recent international policy initiatives reveal an intense interest in the relationship between social capital and democracy. This interest is the most recent variant of a long theoretical tradition positing that a vigorous associational life is beneficial for the creation and maintenance of democracy. Despite the popularity of this view, little quantitative empirical evidence exists to support the relationship. Here, the relationship between social capital and democracy is tested using data from a large, quantitative, cross-national study. Two additional tests are introduced. First, the plausible reciprocal effect--from democracy to social capital--is included in models. Second, the potentially negative impact of some associations on democracy is considered. Using data from the World Values Survey and the Union of International Associations in a cross-lagged panel design, results show that social capital affects democracy and that democracy affects social capital. Additional tests demonstrate that associations that are connected to the larger community have a positive effect on democracy, while isolated associations have a negative effect. Theory relating social capital to democracy is drawn from the literature on civil society, political culture, and social movements. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

It focuses in particular on discontinuity in the context of continuity, on decontextualization, naturalization and responsibility as key concerns of both perspectives on the industrial way of life. It makes explicit the temporal underpinnings of that cultural form with respect to five Cs: the creation of time to human design (C1), the commodification of time (C2), the compression of time (C3), the control of time (C4,) and the colonization of time (C5). It concludes that explicit concern with temporal relations shows reflexive modernization in action and facilitates improved knowledge for deliberative change. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Despite the movement's basic roots in the middle class, there are grounds for believing that it is spreading to the industrial working class as well.},

This disagreement is linked to politics and social structure, with older, high SES, politically conservative respondents preferring markedly higher pay for elite occupations, but usually not preferring lower pay for ordinary jobs.

abstract = {(from the chapter) Four basic issues are addressed in this research: What are the substantive contents of human values? Can we identify a comprehensive set of values? To what extent is the meaning of particular values equivalent for different groups of people? How are the relations among different values structured? First, this chapter identifies 10 motivationally distinct value types that are likely to be recognized within and across cultures and used to form value priorities. Second, the author demonstrates that this set of value types is relatively comprehensive, encompassing virtually all the types of values to which individuals attribute at least moderate importance as criteria of evaluation. Third, evidence from 20 countries is assembled showing that the meaning of the value types and of most of the single values that constitute them is reasonable equivalent across most groups. Finally, the author discovers two basic dimensions that organizes value systems into an integrated motivational structure with consistent value conflicts and compatibilities.

@article{Campbell1998,
annote = {Campbell zeigt zun\"{a}chst auf wie historischer und „organizational“ Institutionalismus den Einfluss von Ideen auf Politikgestaltung ber\"{u}cksichtigen. Sein eigentlicher Beitrag ist, dass er eine Konzeptionalisierung von Ideen liefert, die k\"{u}nftig den empirischen Nachweis des Einflusses von Ideen erleichtern soll. Er ordnet Ideen – je nachdem, ob sie kognitiv oder normativ und ob sie Gegenstand der Debatte oder unterschwellige Annahmen sind – in vier verschiedene Typen ein: Programs, paradigms, frames und public sentiments. Jedem dieser Typen ordnet er auch einen Wirkmechanismus zu. Jeden Mechanismus wendet er auf die Wirtschaftspolitik in den USA der 1970er und fr\"{u}hen 1980er Jahre an.
Kommentar: Die Unterscheidung ist sowohl als analytischer Ansatz als auch in seiner taxonomischen Funktion hilfreich. Die \"{U}bertragung seiner Unterscheidungen auf den konkreten Gegenstand ist gut nachvollziehbar. Zus\"{a}tzlich werden weitere unterst\"{u}tzende Faktoren f\"{u}r den „Sieg“ der supply-side economics deutlich wie Einfachheit und Verst\"{a}ndlichkeit der Argumentation, etc},

In an effort to interrogate and problematize these mediated images; that is, what is ''womanhood'' and who are ''ethnic minorities,'' a move from complicity to implicature theory is offered.

abstract = {Abstract. This article demonstrates that socioeconomic development, emancipative cultural change and democratization constitute a coherent syndrome of social progress - a syndrome whose common focus has not been properly specified by classical modernization theory. We specify this syndrome as 'human development', arguing that its three components have a common focus on broadening human choice. Socioeconomic development gives people the objective means of choice by increasing individual resources; rising emancipative values strengthen people's subjective orientation towards choice; and democratization provides legal guarantees of choice by institutionalizing freedom rights. Analysis of data from the World Values Surveys demonstrates that the linkage between individual resources, emancipative values and freedom rights is universal in its presence across nations, regions and cultural zones; that this human development syndrome is shaped by a causal effect of individual resources and emancipative values on freedom rights; and that this effect operates through its impact on elite integrity, as the factor which makes freedom rights effective.

          Welfare-State Regress in Western Europe: Politics, Institutions, Globalization, and Europeanization
        
        
         - Korpi, Walter )

        
        
The postindustrial explanation of retrenchment (Pierson) is neatly summarized here.

        
It is also known as TINA, really.

        
ibid: 590
Basic to the new-politics perspective is the hypothe- sis that, in the retrenchment phase, the major forces driving welfare-state change no longer come from distributive conflicts among socioeconomic interest groups, but rather emanate from postindustrial changes (Pierson 2001b). Growing ser- vice sectors decrease economic growth rates, whereas the graying of populations, changing family patterns, increasing share of women in the public sector labor force, and maturation of government welfare commitments all tend to increase social expenditures. Such postindustrial changes generate intense and persistent pressures on government budgets (Pierson 2001a). The cold star of permanent austerity therefore guides governments of all political shades to attempt cuts in social expenditure 

        

        
Think hard about this one: Korpi says (ibid: 592) that from a power resources perspective, full employment was key, because, arguably, full employment guaranteed a good bargaining position etc. So for these guys full employment is the key dependent variable of welfare state retrenchment.

        
I don't know exactly how to get my head around this. But for my argument so far, unemployment was the result of a poor welfare state, not so much the desiderata of a good one. Think about this!

        
Offe and other ideas of guaranteed income are clearly in the same vain: they are meant to reduce the pressure, it's classical power resources. But is it true, political-economy-wise?

        
Develop more systematically, with regard to Korpi 593 an idea of how to measure welfare state efficacy. (I think something of growth AND equality). That's the deal. Argue that either spending (danger: unemployment, debt, ...) or full employment (danger: low growth, debt) don't work. It'll be interesting only when we come up with a normative counterfactual of efficiency and equity, and that they DO work together. Once we've got that, we can think about the analysis.

        
ibid: 594
Pierson's conclusion that the "British welfare state, if battered, remains intact" was especially persuasive (Pierson 1994, p. 161) 
is too early to tell, and too shorthand a conclusion. Maybe welfare retrenchment is not the question. Maybe welfare-non-expansion is the question (think: answer the postindustrial problem of low productivity growth in the service economy by education, education, education, broad-based capital for innovation).

        
The war economies (WWII US, UK) are interesting historical epochs indeed; wide expansion of output and full employment (referenced in ibid: 594: "full employment is possible in the real world").

        
go for it: it's not exactly clear how this track+trace of welfare state retrenchment serves those people who pay for the science.

        

        
ibid: 603
National policies to maintain full employment are likely to be much more sensitive to, and de- pendent on, international developments than social-insurance and -service pro- grams are 
zu kurz gesprungen! There is a link: progressive taxation, financing of the welfare state was the one thing that allowed full employment! That's the link!

        

        
Here's an example of how the discussion isn't nearly sophisticated enough. The following is false (ibid: 603):
In analyzing the role of international political and economic changes for na- tional policy making, distinguishing between different policy sectors in welfare states is fruitful. One important distinction is found between policies to main- tain full employment and social insurance and social services. National policies to maintain full employment are likely to be much more sensitive to, and de- pendent on, international developments than social-insurance and -service pro- grams are. Of relevance here is that, with the exception of the largest economies, most Western countries are markedly export dependent. As Fligstein \& Merand (2002) noted, trade growth has been especially pronounced within the E.U. When countries in economic crises decrease their imports, export possibilities in other countries decline and their unemployment problems mount, thereby likely cre- ating a situation that pressures governments to make cuts in social-insurance and -service programs. In Europe full employment after the end of World War II was conditioned by Bretton-Woods institutions, giving national governments influence over cross-border capital flows while liberalizing cross-border trade. With the dismantling of cross-border capital controls and increasing economic integration within Europe, if unemployment is allowed to rise in some coun- tries, maintaining full employment becomes very difficult, especially for smaller countries.

        

        
good point: ibid: 604 comes up with some evidence and arguments on why skill-biased technological change may be an artefact.

        

        
At the basis of this analytical as well as political enterprise lies a very simple contention: could this be a better place? Yes, it could be.

abstract = {"An important and timely message about the biological roots of human kindness."—Desmond Morris, author of The Naked ApeAre we our brothers' keepers? Do we have an instinct for compassion? Or are we, as is often assumed, only on earth to serve our own survival and interests? In this thought-provoking book, the acclaimed author of Our Inner Ape examines how empathy comes naturally to a great variety of animals, including humans. By studying social behaviors in animals, such as bonding, the herd instinct, the forming of trusting alliances, expressions of consolation, and conflict resolution, Frans de Waal demonstrates that animals–and humans–are "preprogrammed to reach out." He has found that chimpanzees care for mates that are wounded by leopards, elephants offer "reassuring rumbles" to youngsters in distress, and dolphins support sick companions near the water's surface to prevent them from drowning. From day one humans have innate sensitivities to faces, bodies, and voices; we've been designed to feel for one another.De Waal's theory runs counter to the assumption that humans are inherently selfish, which can be seen in the fields of politics, law, and finance, and whichseems to be evidenced by the current greed-driven stock market collapse. But he cites the public's outrage at the U.S. government's lack of empathy in the wake of Hurricane Katrina as a significant shift in perspective–one that helped Barack Obama become elected and ushered in what may well become an Age of Empathy. Through a better understanding of empathy's survival value in evolution, de Waal suggests, we can work together toward a more just society based on a more generous and accurate view of human nature.Written in layman's prose with a wealth of anecdotes, wry humor, and incisive intelligence, The Age of Empathy is essential reading for our embattled times.From the Hardcover edition.},

abstract = {In reply to Welzel and Inglehart in this issue, we deploy three lines of criticism. First, we argue that their newly invented construct ''effective democracy'' is conceptually and empirically flawed. Second, we show that their results are highly sensitive to model specification. Regardless of the time period, their supportive evidence vanishes if a more pertinent measure of democracy is used instead of measures based on the absence of corruption, if a broader index of socioeconomic modernization is controlled for, and if their compound index of emancipative values is replaced by its core component: liberty aspirations. Third, we find that emancipative values are not a coherent syndrome at the individual level within countries, rendering the causal mechanism linking these values to democracy through collective action unintelligible. We conclude that democratic values are not a robust determinant of democratization. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

annote = {There are big tectonic plates moving, that are causing the dysfunctions of democracy (agreed). 339.

        
339: minipublics "look like, because they are, exercises in “reformist tinkering” rather than “revolutionary reform.”5

        
This is good, says Fung, because it's a starting point and b) "effective large-scale public sphere reforms may consist largely in the proliferation of better minipublics rather than improving the one big public"

        
agreed. This is good stuff. I agree because it's hand on and b) because there can be no solution to the crisis of democracy at the large scale; there'll always be a prisoners dilemma. It would be illiberal to ban defection.

        
This requires an account of how democracy used to work (I take this from the one really old study in the Roosevelt election, Carpini?: at that point, interests and voting aligned. Questions where, essentially, pretty simple. And maybe even zero-sum.
We should be grateful that that is no longer the case.
Tax is a case in point; there used to be a clear-cut case in tax, when capital was a class in itself (savings norms!), and when unions were strong wage bargainer (incidence of corporate tax!).

        
this is the impetus for the small-scale, local bias of deliberative democracy: deliberation. Some areas
would benefit very little from deliberation because they require highly specialized
kinds of knowledge or training or because citizens have no distinctive insight or
information.18 On the other hand, many areas of public concern stand to benefit
from increased public deliberation. To ide

        
Note that this is a good reason for tax as a case: It's about as large-scale as it gets. (like monetary policy, maybe, or trade?). Also, the mismatch between public discourse and the actual abstractions governing tax is hardly ever as colossal as here (or so I hope) ( Make a pun about this; that I don't hope other policy areas are affected by similar problems).

        
have an outing: there's lots of stuff that I'd have to do for the large-scale deliberation that isn't actually PhD work (think invitations, catering, media work). So there's good reason to do this externally.

        
Include in schedule:
- learn how to attract a huge grant
- budget the project (very roughly)
- identify possible donors
- talk to BIGSSS; can they handle the money?
- talk to BIGSSS: how much money can I get from them (as a pretest!)

        
I somehow need to comment on, and get around the problem that the deliberative forum that I do cannot actually pass or implement whatever they opt for.

        
Also look into dieners planungszellen.

        
Maybe you want to consider the table again on page 353 to see exactly where my forum fits in, if it does.

        
situate myself in this mess:
liberals, communitarians, critical theorists
and radical democrats

        

        
This really is a key question: how do you scale up deliberation? Can you? should you? 365:
How to make sure it's not beans-n'-rice democracy?
A liberal egalitarian, for example, might be attracted
to the ways in which the Citizen Summit or Deliberative Poll informs citizens
and perhaps allows them to develop and practice civic virtues associated with
participation, but object to the potential of the Oregon Health Plan, Chicago
community policing, or Porto Alegre’s Participatory Budgeting structure to
generate unjust policies. On the other hand, radical democrats are attracted
to the strong public, empowered, features of Chicago community policing
and Participatory Budgeting, but may view weak minipublics as irrelevant
epiphenomena or instruments of co-optation.

        
Footnote: The "wire" tells you just how futile even community policed and COMSTAT empowered law enforcement can be. Sometimes the questions are just a little bigger.

        

        
I might have to get back to this for the eventuel thesis to situate my design.

@article{Eikemo2008a,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine whether the magnitude of income-related health inequalities varies between welfare regimes (Scandinavian, Anglo-Saxon, Bismarckian, Southern and Eastern). Specifically, it examined whether the Scandinavian welfare state regime has smaller income-based health inequalities than the other welfare state regimes. METHODS: The first (2002) and second (2004) waves of the representative cross-sectional European Social Survey (ESS), which comprised more than 80 000 respondents, were used to analyse income inequalities (relative health difference between the first and third income tertile) in self-reported health (general health, limiting longstanding illness) amongst those aged 25 or more. Data related to 23 European countries classified into five welfare state regimes. The study controlled for age and adjusted for educational attainment. RESULTS: When comparing the health of the first income tertile with the third, the Scandinavian countries only seemed to hold an intermediate position: they did not have the smallest, or the largest, health inequalities. However, the Anglo-Saxon welfare states had the largest income-related health inequalities for both men and women, while countries with Bismarckian welfare states tended to demonstrate the smallest. This pattern was unchanged after controlling for educational attainment. However, education seemed to explain the largest part of income-related health inequalities in the Southern regime. CONCLUSION: This study shows that the magnitudes of income-related health inequalities indeed vary by welfare state regime. However, this variation was not always in the direction expected as the Scandinavian countries did not exhibit the smallest health inequalities.},

abstract = {People tend to hold overly favorable views of their abilities in many social and intellectual domains. The authors suggest that this overestimation occurs, in part, because people who are unskilled in these domains suffer a dual burden: Not only do these people reach erroneous conclusions and make unfortunate choices, but their incompetence robs them of the metacognitive ability to realize it. Across 4 studies, the authors found that participants scoring in the bottom quartile on tests of humor, grammar, and logic grossly overestimated their test performance and ability. Although their test scores put them in the 12th percentile, they estimated themselves to be in the 62nd. Several analyses linked this miscalibration to deficits in metacognitive skill, or the capacity to distinguish accuracy from error. Paradoxically, improving the skills of participants, and thus increasing their metacognitive competence, helped them recognize the limitations of their abilities.},

abstract = {We demonstrate by mathematical analysis and systematic computer simulations that redistribution can lead to sustainable growth in a society. In accordance with economic models of risky human capital, we assume that dynamics of human capital is modeled as a multiplicative stochastic process which, in the long run, leads to the destruction of individual human capital. When agents are linked by fully redistributive taxation the situation might turn to individual growth in the long run. We consider that a government collects a proportion of income and reduces it by a fraction as costs for administration (efficiency losses). The remaining public good is equally redistributed to all agents. Sustainable growth is induced by redistribution despite the losses from the random growth process and despite administrative costs. Growth results from a portfolio effect. The findings are verified for three different tax schemes: proportional tax, taking proportionally more from the rich, and proportionally more from the poor. We discuss which of these tax schemes performs better with respect to maximize growth under a fixed rate of administrative costs, and the governmental income. This leads us to general conclusions about governmental decisions, the relation to public good games with free riding, and the function of taxation in a risk-taking society.},

Regional integration can also raise income inequality. Beckfield 2006 lists the ways in which the EU can harm the welfare state (968)
Here's my thought: consider how the EU constrained welfare state construction in Eastern Europe. Then consider how these welfare states will determine their future (are they stable?) and what they will mean for income inequality.
I don't think the question is so much whether there's more political (Therborn 1999) vs. economic integration (Scharpf 1997) (ibid 965), the question really is what kind of political integration.

        
ibid 965 says that political integration increases inequality through its effects on the welfare state, economic integration should increase income inequality thorugh the pressures in international wage and employment competition.

        
Use the key term which is: regional integration

        
Regionalization, as ibid argues 966 is "deeper" than globalization. Maybe the welfare state retrenchment is also a different, more complicated one.

        
ibid 968 lists four reasons for welfare state retrenchment in the course of regional integration:

        
  1. convergence criteria (you've gotta stick to Maastricht for the EMU) lead to austerity
  2. diffusion of market-oriented policy scripts (cf. Schellinger) (negative, regulatory integration)
    1. cite Scharpf (1997? ibid) on regulatory competition
  3. politics of retrenchment (you get to avoid blame)
  4. policy ptions are tied to economic forces (Korpi 2003: 603, as cited in ibid)
I'm not sure about this list. I think 1 is misunderstood: the convergence criteria, properly understood, never asked for austerity, they asked for sound fiscal policy. The question is: why could the states only cut spending, rather than, say, increase taxation.
Here's a nice quote: "Regional integration explains nearly half of the rise in income inequality within these Western European countries over the period 1973-1997" (ibid. 979). and this is before the really heterogeneous expansion, and it's without a counterfactual. (this is controlling for national economic development, national welfare states, globalization and other factors).

abstract = {The terms 'quality-of-life', 'well-being' and 'happiness' denote different meanings; sometimes they are used as an umbrella term for all of value, and at other times to denote special merits. This paper is about the specific meanings of the terms. It proposes a classification based on two bi-partitions; between life 'chances' and life 'results', and between 'outer' and 'inner' qualities. Together these dichotomies imply four qualities of life: 1) livability of the environment, 2) life-ability of the individual, 3) external utility of life and 4) inner appreciation of life. This fourfold matrix is applied in three ways: firstly to place related notions and alternative classifications, secondly to explore substantive meanings in various measures for quality of life and thirdly to find out whether quality-of-life can be measured comprehensively. This last question is answered in the negative. Current sum-scores make little sense. The most inclusive measure is still how long and happily people live. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

@book{Fischer1996a,
abstract = {As debate rages over the widening and destructive gap between the rich and the rest of Americans, Claude Fischer and his colleagues present a comprehensive new treatment of inequality in America. They challenge arguments that expanding inequality is the natural, perhaps necessary, accompaniment of economic growth. They refute the claims of the incendiary bestseller The Bell Curve (1994) through a clear, rigorous re-analysis of the very data its authors, Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray, used to contend that inherited differences in intelligence explain inequality. Inequality by Design offers a powerful alternative explanation, stressing that economic fortune depends more on social circumstances than on IQ, which is itself a product of society. More critical yet, patterns of inequality must be explained by looking beyond the attributes of individuals to the structure of society. Social policies set the "rules of the game" within which individual abilities and efforts matter. And recent policies have, on the whole, widened the gap between the rich and the rest of Americans since the 1970s.Not only does the wealth of individuals' parents shape their chances for a good life, so do national policies ranging from labor laws to investments in education to tax deductions. The authors explore the ways that America--the most economically unequal society in the industrialized world--unevenly distributes rewards through regulation of the market, taxes, and government spending. It attacks the myth that inequality fosters economic growth, that reducing economic inequality requires enormous welfare expenditures, and that there is little we can do to alter the extent of inequality. It also attacks the injurious myth of innate racial inequality, presenting powerful evidence that racial differences in achievement are the consequences, not the causes, of social inequality. By refusing to blame inequality on an unchangeable human nature and an inexorable market--an excuse that leads to resignation and passivity--Inequality by Design shows how we can advance policies that widen opportunity for all.},

@article{Ryfe2007,
abstract = {This essay draws insights from Pierre Bourdieus field theory for the development of a so- ciological theory of deliberation. Most work on deliberative practice is strongly shaped by the concerns of deliberative democratic theory, and that theory tends to approach deliberation as a procedural mechanism for decision-making. Thus, there has been very little effort to theorize the sociological dimensions of deliberative practice. Bourdieus theory highlights a crucial dilemma in that practice. Efforts to infuse community politics with deliberation represent a politics of the most fundamental kind: a struggle to redefine the preferred categories, rules, roles, values, and behaviors that structure public life. But deliberation itself does not constitute a cohesive field of social activity. There is no common sense definition of what deliberation is, or how to tell a good deliberator from a bad one; moreover, as yet one can achieve no social distinction or status from embracing deliberation. Thus, members of a community engage in a fundamental political struggle without a shared sense of what they are doing or why they are doing it, and without the rewards of status or distinction that come with participation in an ongoing social field. Illustrated with examples from two years of ethnographic fieldwork into the practice of deliberation, this theory shows deliberation to be a fluid, sociologically complex and politically charged exercise.},

abstract = {Evolutionary theory postulates that altruistic behavior evolved for the return-benefits it bears the performer. For return-benefits to play a motivational role, however, they need to be experienced by the organism. Motivational analyses should restrict themselves, therefore, to the altruistic impulse and its knowable consequences. Empathy is an ideal candidate mechanism to underlie so-called directed altruism, i.e., altruism in response to anothers's pain, need, or distress. Evidence is accumulating that this mechanism is phylogenetically ancient, probably as old as mammals and birds. Perception of the emotional state of another automatically activates shared representations causing a matching emotional state in the observer. With increasing cognition, state-matching evolved into more complex forms, including concern for the other and perspective-taking. Empathy-induced altruism derives its strength from the emotional stake it offers the self in the other's welfare. The dynamics of the empathy mechanism agree with predictions from kin selection and reciprocal altruism theory.},

Kommentar: Die Fallstudie hat den Vorteil, dass das Thema Rauchverbot keine wirtschaftswissenschaftliche Kenntnisse voraussetzt und damit der Beitrag leicht zu lesen ist. Die Unterschiede zwischen den Regionen des UK sind aber vermutlich f\"{u}r Ihre Arbeiten nicht sonderlich relevant und die Durchsetzung des Raumverbots ist als solche wenig erkl\"{a}rungsbed\"{u}rftig.

71
        
        
        
of such deliberative democratic processes?
        
Deliberative processes are essential to. the rationality of collective decisionmaking
        
processes for three reasons. First, as Bernard Manin has observed in an
        
excellent article "On Legitimacy and Deliberation," deliberative processes are
        
also processes that impart information.1o New information is imparted because
        
1) no single individual can anticipate and foresee all the variety of perspectives
        
through which matters of ethics and politics would be perceived by
        
different individuals; and 2) no Single individual can possess all the information
        
deemed relevant to a certain decision affecting alL II Deliberation is a
        
procedure for being informed.
        
Furthermore, much political theory under the influence of economic models
        
of reasoning in particular proceeds from a methodological fiction: this is .
        
the methodological fiction of an individual with an ordered set of coherent
        
preferences. This fiction does not have much relevance in the political world.
        
On complex social and political issues, more often than not, individuals may
        
have views and wishes but no ordered set of preferences, since the latter
        
would imply that they would be enlightened not only about the preferences
        
but about the consequences and relative merits of each of their preferred
        
choices in advance. It is actually the deliberative process itself that is likely to
        
produce such an outcome by leading the individual to further critical reflection
        
on his already held views and opinions; it is incoherent to assume that
        
individuals can start a process of public deliberation with a level of conceptual
        
clarity about their choices and preferences that can actually result only from
        
a successful process of deliberation. Likewise, the formation of coherent
        
preferences cannot precede deliberation; it can only succeed it. Very often
        
individuals' wishes as well as views and opinions conflict with one another. In
        
the course of deliberation and the exchange of views with others, individuals
        
become more aware of such conflicts and feel compelled to undertake a
        
coherent ordering.
        
        
        
        
        
74: Criticisms of deliberative democracy
        
first, liberal theorists will express concern that such a strong
        
model would lead to the corrosion of individual liberties and may in fact
        
destabilize the rule of law. In his earlier work, Bruce Ackerman had formulated
        
a theory of "conversational neutrality" to voice some of these concerns.17
        
Stephen Holmes has defended the plausibility of certain "gag rules" on public
        
conversation. IS Second, feminist theorists are skeptical about this model, because
        
they see it as privileging a certain mode of discourse at the cost of silencing
        
others: this is the rationalist, male, univocal, hegemonic discourse of a
        
transparent polity that disregards the emotions, polyvocity, multiplicity, and
        
differences in the articulation of the voice of the public; third, institutionalists
        
. and realists consider this discourse model to be hopelessly naive, maybe even
        
dangerous, in its seemingly plebiscitary and anti-institutional implications. I
        
would briefly like to consider these objections.

Class Notes

        
   * Olaf says: it's kind of like social integration (CME) and system integration (LME) in sociology.
      * Olaf says: if you believe that society should form common norms and some degree of integration, than you really should be more in favor of the CME. (?!?)
   * Olaf is of course right, Hall + Soskice is a functionalist argument, not a conflict approach.
      * This may be a very productive prism to look through for my thesis. Let's look at arguments for/against the tax, looking through conflict, functionalism etc.
      * (This would be my first order question: what kind of arguments to people make, based on what kind of epistemology? (functionalism, etc.) I could prime them with these frameworks, including an elaborated version of Hall/Soskice.
      * The second order question would be: how come that experts use these, and not other epistemologies?
   * Here's another thought: Hall and Soskice don't feature power, or "exploitation", maybe because their "strategic" orientation on firms implies that a firm is always a positive sum proposition, never a zero-sum proposition. Of course if it were zero-sum, there wouldn't be coordination problem. If you have power, you don't need to cooperate/coordinate.
   * Think hard about whether Hall and Soskice can, in fact, be treated independent of distributive outcomes.
   * notice that by engaging Hall and Soskice, I complicate my (stupid) dichotomy between (welfare) state and market: it becomes a question of endogeneity and of equilibrium.

Here's an idea of how to resolve this: to respectfully disagree with Shapiro. Totally in the deliberative spirit.
        
Shapiro seems concerned (saddened, resigniert really) about the power of money (cf. Hillary health bill) in American politics. In effect, his question is Fungs' revolution question.
        
I am sympathetic with Shapiro's worries. I will have to look at Gutmann and THompson and see how critical they really are.},

Even more surprising was the discovery that power-law distributions also characterize many biological and social networks. Many attributed a deep significance to this fact, inferring a "universal architecture" of complex systems. Closer examination, however, challenges the assumptions that (1) such distributions are special and (2) they signify a common architecture, independent of the system's specifics. The real surprise, if any, is that power-law distributions are easy to generate, and by a variety of mechanisms. The architecture that results is not universal, but particular; it is determined by the actual constraints on the system in question.},

Also consider: groupthink, and other dysfunctions (Kuran, Noelle-Neumann), and how to counter this. It seems, what would be important would be GOOD moderators, a place that is curiously underinvestigated as someone wrote in the special issue.

abstract = {There is increasing recognition in the health promotion and population health fields that the primary determinants of health lay outside the health care and behavioural risk arenas. Many of these factors involve public policy decisions made by governments that influence the distribution of income, degree of social security, and quality and availability of education, food, and housing, among others. These non-medical and non-lifestyle factors have come to be known as the social determinants of health. In many nations--and this is especially the case in North America--recent policy decisions are undermining these social determinants of health. A political economy analysis of the forces supporting as well as threatening the welfare state is offered as a means of both understanding these policy decisions and advancing the health promotion and population health agendas. The building blocks of social democracies--the political systems that seem most amenable to securing the social determinants of health--are identified as key to promoting health. Health promoters and population health researchers need to "get political" and recognize the importance of political and social action in support of health.},

@book{Cohen2000,
abstract = {This book presents G. A. Cohen's Gifford Lectures, delivered at the University of Edinburgh in 1996. Focusing on Marxism and Rawlsian liberalism, Cohen draws a connection between these thought systems and the choices that shape a person's life. In the case of Marxism, the relevant life is his own: a communist upbringing in the 1940s in Montreal, which induced a belief in a strongly socialist egalitarian doctrine. The narrative of Cohen's reckoning with that inheritance develops through a series of sophisticated engagements with the central questions of social and political philosophy.In the case of Rawlsian doctrine, Cohen looks to people's lives in general. He argues that egalitarian justice is not only, as Rawlsian liberalism teaches, a matter of rules that define the structure of society, but also a matter of personal attitude and choice. Personal attitude and choice are, moreover, the stuff of which social structure itself is made. Those truths have not informed political philosophy as much as they should, and Cohen's focus on them brings political philosophy closer to moral philosophy, and to the Judeo-Christian ethical tradition, than it has recently been.},

Results from four national panel surveys show that correlations among measures of SWB diminish over time, and that the SWB set points of a minority of individuals substantially change. These results mean that DE theory requires revision to make it more dynamic and enable it to better account for medium term change in SWB. The paper identifies personality traits and life events associated with subsequent changes in SWB. Data come from German, British and Australian panel surveys in which SWB has been measured for between 9 and 20 years. Panel regression random and fixed effects models were used to analyse the data.},

@article{BeckBonss-2003-aa,
abstract = {How can one distinguish the concept of second modernity from the concept of postmodernity? Postmodernists are interested in deconstruction without reconstruction, second modernity is about deconstruction and reconstruction. Social sciences need to construct new concepts to understand the world dynamics at the beginning of the 21st century. Modernity has not vanished, we are not post it. Radical social change has always been part of modernity. What is new is that modernity has begun to modernize its own foundations. This is what it means to say modernity has become reflexive. It has become directed at itself. This causes huge new problems both in reality and in theory. There has been a pluralization of the boundaries within and between societies, between society and nature, between Us and Other, between life and death. This pluralization also changes the inherent nature of boundaries. They become not so much boundaries as a variety of attempts to draw of boundaries. Border conflicts become transformed into conflicts over the drawing of boundaries. Where postmodernism simply celebrates this multiplication of boundaries, the theory of second modernity starts with the problem this new reality poses for individual and collective decisions, and with the problem that the continued existence of such decisions poses for theory. Institutions that are capable of such conscious boundary drawing are enabled in a way that those of the first modernity were not. But this process also generates qualitatively new kinds of trouble and crises. To investigate those troubles is to unveil the emergence of the second modernity. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

interestingly however, this lip-service to meritocracy is contradicted by a sense of too large income inequalities (larer than in the early 1990s) (more than half agree that they are much too large).
        
"The presented data show that the shift towards merit-based distributive principles has not been paralleled by a growing acceptance of the existing income inequalities." (ibid: 120).
        
ibid says there are two reasons: maybe the process of post-soviet transition wasn't meritocratic. Or maybe there is what they call an "egalitarian understanding" of meritocratic principles.
        
"These figures clearly indicate that perceiving the existing income inequalities as being too large and thus illegitimate does not necessarily lead to a demand to redress them radically" (ibid: 124) Be careful here, Max. The stats are a little dodgy, and confused. There seems not to be a clear picture.

Dear Iryna, Dear all,
unfortunately, I'll miss today's core theory class because I am in
Berlin (on a class trip with my students).
I just read the text and Iryna's review (thanks!), and at least wanted
to give me two cents (meinen Senf).

Integrated microfoundations theory of income generation
"Few researchers have approached the task of analyzing the effects of
different variables on the poverty rate in the context of a coherent
overall model of the process by which income is generated. (...) We
are swamped with facts about people's incomes and about the number and
composition of people who inhabit the lower tail, but don't know very
much about the process that generates these results." (Sawhill 1988:
1085)
I thought this was very illuminating; such an integrated theory indeed
seems direly required.This is from 1988. What's the state of the art
in terms of theory building?Such a theory may also be important to
think about poverty duration. Does that make sense to you, Iryna?
Definition of Poverty: Relative or Absolute(this pertains to Iryna's
discussion point \#1)So Sawhill (1988: 1075) subscribes to a classical,
mainstream definition: poverty is absolute lack or scarcity of
material resources (Orshansky index is, after all based on an economy
food plan)
Do we agree with that?I find more compelling a definition of relative
poverty. Recent empirical evidence (reviewed in Wilkinson \& Pickett
2009) seems to suggest that in fact, people respond to relatively low
status in addition to, and independent of scarcity of resources.
Notably, the stress responses to low relative status appear to include
poor (mental!) health, education and attitudinal maladaptions
("culture of poverty") (all of which are mentioned in Sawhill 1988).
All of which suggests: we should be thinking of poverty in relative
terms, not in absolute terms.And yes of course this means that a
reduction in poverty depends on a compression of the income
distribution. So what? I'm not sure I understand the analytical
difference between income distribution and poverty in the first place.
Discounting Poverty Away
I disagree with some of the discount factors that Sawhill suggested to
measure the incidence of poverty. Here are some:The Wider Families
(ibid.: 1080). Sawhill seems to suggest to include those material
resources in the wider family that poor people may have access to.
First, we should stick, as Sawhill suggests elsewhere, to a treatment
of poverty analogous to that in income taxation. In income taxation
the unit of taxation are married couples and their dependent children.
You're not income taxed on the money that some distant uncle makes.
Consequently, that should also not be considered as income for any
poverty definition.
Second, the welfare state's goal was always to replace these very
wider family transfers.Fragmented households.To assume that
"fragmented households were at least partly voluntary", and to treat
"privacy and autonomy (...) as normal goods" (1080).
"Access that they may have forgone as the price of greater independence" (1080).
This view of family relations is frankly illiberal, and unacceptable
even from an economist.
- including nonmarket time / leisure.
Again, I find this problematic. First, this assumes that nonmarket
time is, indeed, a choice. Second, if we are to include free time, we
might also include a positive minimum.
Lastly the discussion of the wealth of poor people (their cars, homes)
seems questionable. An average net worth of 30k is, including many
illiquid assets or things necessary to work and live (housing, car)
not an amount worth deducting.
All in all this "erbsenz\"{a}hlerei" discounting of who REALLY is poor
reminded me of the Dickensian (The Chimes) Aldeman Cute and his
Political economist (!) friend Mr Filer, heartlessly berating their
abjectly poor messenger Trotty for his christmas meal "extravagance".
I'm all for rigorous operationalizations but that shouldn't take us
back to Victorian notions of poverty.

annote = {Two countries (Latvia and Poland) have already reacted to this 'demographic
wave' in the pension reform debate and have .introduced the first
pillar as a defmed contribution system, where the sum of all contributions
paid in are converted into an annuity. This means that the average life expectancy
at retirement age is a decisive factor for the amount of monthly
pension payment. Adaptations to a changing demographic framework are
automatically included in the pension formula, so that the additional burden
of rising life expectancy will not be carried by the current working population
through higher contribution rates - as in a defined benefit system - but
will lead directly to lower pension payments, so that the entire burden is carried
by the pensioners themselves.I5
The impact of the demographic setting

And again it falls considerably short on any systematic understanding of demographic change. AGING and SHRINKING are to distinct phenomena.
        
The literature doesn't go nearly deeply enough to render visible the systemic choices that are out there. It naturalizes them.

@book{Kamarck2002,
abstract = {Economics as a Social Science is a highly readable critique of economic theory, based on a wide range of research, that endeavors to restore economics to its proper role as a social science. Contrary to conventional economic theory, which assumes that people have no free will, this book instead bases economics on the realistic assumption that human beings can choose; that we are complex beings affected by emotion, custom, habit, and reason; and that our behavior varies with circumstances and times. It embraces the findings of history, psychology, and other social sciences and the insights from great literature on human behavior as opposed to the rigidity set by mathematical axioms that define how economics is understood and practiced today.Andrew M. Kamarck demonstrates that only rough accuracy is attainable in economic measurement, and that understanding an economy requires knowledge from other disciplines. The canonical hypotheses of economics (perfect rationality, self-interest, equilibrium) are shown to be inadequate (and in the case of "equilibrium" to be counterproductive to understanding the forces that dominate the economy), and more satisfactory assumptions provided. The market is shown to work imperfectly and to require appropriate institutions to perform its function reasonably well. Further, Kamarck argues that self-interest does not always lead to helping the general interest.Economics as a Social Science examines and revises the fundamental assumptions of economics. Because it avoids jargon and explains terms carefully, it will be of interest to economics majors as well as to graduate students of economics and other social sciences, and social scientists working in government and the private sector.Andrew M. Kamarck is former Director, Economic Development Institute, the World Bank.},

annote = {5: "His Harvard colleague, N. Gregory Mankiw, pointed out that the theorem is inconsistent with the empirical findings that consumption tracks current income and numerous households with near zero wealth could not, even if they wanted to, save more to help their descendants pay higher taxes in the future (Mankiw 200b, 121). Paul Samuelson more devastatingly commented that "it is not without humour to hear a grown scholar allege that each new tax reduction will cause us to save more against the day when our children will be taxed to meet the entailed deficit (1989,98). Barrow's theory, imposingly entiteld the Ricardian equivalence theorem, is rather an instance of what Schumpeter called Ricardian vice - jumping to policy conclusions from a highly abstract base.
Following on from this, there is a widespread view to which even some highly regarded theorists succumb to on occasion: The results of a market perating without government interference, which may lead to Pareto-optimum (i.e., no reallocation of resources and output can make anyone better off without making at least one person worse off), is confused with an optimum optimorum (the best of the best) - a Panglossian best of all possible worlds. But this neglects the important factors of the effects of income distribution and ethical considerations."},

Note the link between falsifiability and substantive standards of justice; you can't do without.

        
clarify: my design aims to test whether deliberative democracy yields a different (better?) design. It's not about whether the standards to be considered deliberative are met.

        
so I think I have the following design in mind:

        
- first, I assume that deliberative democracy WILL enhance the understanding of tax. If it doesn't, the deliberative forum was insufficient.. This aspect is NOT open to falsification.

        
- second, I assume that better understanding of tax will yield a preference for a PCT. this IS falsifiable/

        
Generally, I think this is a debate that I need to engage. I should give a preview of this debate in my proposal. I need to look much, much more deeply into this.

there's also a point to be made that we should not confuse (as all of this does) regulatory design in industrial relations (fight Mr Burns situation) and redistributive policy. These are different arenas.
        
Write a big-ass criticism of the literature covered in this class: lot's of buzzwords ('social partners', 'sound fiscal policy'), meaningless narrative and very, very little analysis. TINA is all over this literature.
        
Dissect the pension reform bullshit as an example for the lack of analysis. Note, for instance, that the generational incidence is, in principal, independent from the reform. Leaving PAYGO does not necessarily imply that older people will be worse off (as is argued in Horstman et al 2002: 65)
        
 Also argue: research revolving around itself is not good. So my criticism should be only a footnote, or make a more general argument that there's hegemony in this.
        
Then continue: this is how it should be done.
        
        
My basic claim is this: the bullshit TINA thinking has clouded the more fundamental alternatives of post-communist transformation and european integration.

annote = {Anwendung des „multiple-stream“ Ansatzes von Kingdon (1984/95), um die \"{u}berraschende Wende der EU hin zur „partizipativen Demokratie“ zu erkl\"{a}ren. 
„F\"{u}r Kingdon sind politische Entscheidungen nicht der Endpunkt eines rationalen Handlungsprozesses, bei dem auf die Problemdefinition die gezielte Suche nach angemessenen L\"{o}sungsstrategien folgt und unter diesen dann diejenige gew\"{a}hlt wird, die den Pr\"{a}ferenzen der dominierenden Akteure am besten entspricht. Vielmehr betrachtet er Probleme, Handlungsoptionen und den politischen Prozess (problems, policies, politics) als eigenst\"{a}ndige Gr\"{o}\ss en, die sich relativ unabh\"{a}ngig voneinander entwickeln. Er lenkt die Aufmerksamkeit darauf, dass im Verlauf der Zeit Probleme in unterschiedlicher Dringlichkeit auftauchen und wahrgenommen werden, dass alternative Handlungsoptionen immer schon in der Diskussion sind und dass die Aufmerksamkeit und Handlungsbereitschaft politischer Akteure nicht nur problemgetrieben ist, sondern ihrer eigenen Dynamik folgt. Es kommt zur Entscheidung, wenn zu einer gegebenen Zeit die Verschiebungen in der Problemwahrnehmung und in der Er\"{o}rterung von Handlungsalternativen zu passf\"{a}higen Konstellationen f\"{u}hren und zus\"{a}tzlich politische Akteure es als lohnend erachten, sich f\"{u}r die Bearbeitung genau dieses Problems zu engagieren. Der logische Kern des Modells ist »(1) the flow of fairly separate streams through the system, and (2) outcomes heavily dependent on the coupling of the streams (\ldots)« (Kingdon 2003: 86).“ },

What's incorrect
        
   * Inequality is not the result of a (potentially unfair) sorting mechanism scanning for characteristics
"Sorting systems do not evolve naturally." This is the story of their genesis. (31)
        
   * Sorting mechanisms depend on social support.
   * The "social surroundings people grow up [in, MH] [...] affects their adult characteristics". (32)
   * Differences bunch categorically
   * "Categories matter" (33), and they are in the eye of the beholder.
   * The most effective categories are mutually known.
   * How categories and boundaries proliferate:
      * Encounter: when clusters meet other clusters they will construct categories.
      * Imposition: creating a new category
      * Negotiation: example: street gangs
      * Transfer: new people adopt a known division of labor/benefits etc. in their organization of some activity.
   * "Categories always produce difference" (34), but not always inequality.
   * Inequality arises when (comparative advantage!) transactions across the boundary
      * "a) regularly yield net advantages to those on one side"
      * "b) reproduce the boundary" (34)
      * Exploitation (a.k.a. Marx's exploitation): A enlists B for value-producing effort but allocates less than the value added. 
         * (A uses some of the extracted welfare to reinforce the boundaries)
      * Opportunity hoarding (a.k.a. Weber's social closure): A prevents B from participating in the value-producting process
         * (A uses some of the monopolized returns to reinforce boundaries)
      * Emulation: Social organization enjoys economies of scale, or path dependency. A new social organization will copy the opportunity hoarding and exploitation of some old organization. If organization D wants to do business with C, they may have to adapt to the social organization (including exploitation and opportunity hoarding) in D. Example: firms can communicate more easily, if they both have secretaries.
      * Adaptation: there is some (identity politics?) reward for everyone.
   * Many "resources lend themselves to production of benefits for some recipient by means of coordinated effort." (35, emphasis added)
        
Olaf's beef with Tilly: 
        
   * it's way too general mechanism, almost generic sociological processes. It's always about emulation and adaptation. Exactly what's this supposed to add?
   * It's hard to distinguish b/w fairness and injustice here.
   * Bourdieu: state also has the monopoly on the production of new categories (unlawful combatants, US/Guatanmo)
   * S\"{o}rensen: class theory of social closure
   * Erik Olin Wright: on exploitative, game theoretical framework
   * Tylly by contrast is more general, than just class related
      * bourdieu, too?
   * Galtung: structural violence
   * Michael mann: history of inequality and violence
   * Die Soziologie der Armen
   * Olaf: tilly should've written more about the specifically capitalist mode of inequality, adaptation/emulation are more generic (feudal, etc)
   * read: Bourdieu: Elend der Welt
   * foucault: 
   * Dahrendorf: theory on inequality, based on social norms, the production of norms, aexplained by deviation and core/periphery
Questions, Criticism
        
   * I don't understand the obsession about different paradigms (methodological/phenomenological individualism vs. systems theory vs. functionalism vs. relational theory). Can't they be reconciled in that:
   * 
      * yes, given some intuitive understanding or (cultural) evolution (van den Berghe 1998, Brubaker 2001) of this process, even sentient beings can decide to organize durable inequality by cartels. (individualism works).
      * yes, given comparative advantage and cooperation problems (ibid.), categorical discrimination (particularly of the pseudo-biological variant) can function to enhance cooperation and growth. (functionalism works).
   * Actually systems theory is direly missing from this. If we are to understand the magnitude of exploitation and/or opportunity hoarding occurring at the border between A and B, we need to understand 
      * the political economy of cooperative production, 
      * network effects and (Mandelbrotian/fractal?) distributions, 
      * factor allocation, 
      * monopoly power,
      * price elasticities,
      * ... etc.
   * Just as (methodological) individualism may make it very difficult to get at the causal processes going on (supposedly in people's heads) that cause different outcomes, a relational view of inequality makes it that much harder to understand how unequal ability operates.},

I develop a theory of the dynamics of protest waves by comparing data on protests in West Germany between 1965 and 1989 with similar data from the Netherlands, Italy, and the United States. Striking similarities are noted among these different protest waves in the development of action repertoires, levels of repression and facilitation, and the involvement of different types of organizations. An explanation for these dynamic patterns combines external and internal factors: The interplay between facilitation, repression, and the chance of success defines a set of external constraints that combine with activists' choices among three strategic options--innovation, increased participation, or increased militancy.},

Bloemraad, I. (2006). "Becoming a Citizen in the United States and Canada - Structured Mobilization and Immigration Political Incorporation." Social Forces 85(2).
        
This is essentially a short (paper) version of the book Bloemraad 2006b.
        
Reading for: Immigrant Incorporation (Bean)
        
Notes
        
starting point: naturalization as a percentage of foreign borns in the US takes much longer and happens at lower levels than in Canada (667)
innovation here: explain this difference from a social movement scholars working in the tradition of new institutionalism
"Immigrant citizenship and political incorporation is a process akin to social movement mobilization, involving friends, family, co-ethnic organizations and local community leaders" ( 668)
couldn't agree more
Explaining Immigrant Citizenship - Current Theorizing
"Some identify what they see as deterioration in the quality of today’s immigrants (Borjas 1999; Camarota 2001). Newcomers’ lower human capital relative to the native-born allegedly hinders incorporation into the labor market, retards social integration such as language learning and, by extension, undermines immigrants’ naturalization." (670)
How to explain it?
Cost-benefit Arguments and declining significance of citizenship
actor-based explanation: it simply isn't worth it anymore
pro: today, citizenship matters less
example: germany, rights are accorded to non-citizens as well
this of course is a rational model of human behavior
contra: costs of citizenships have not changed and are relatively low (no protection from draft, et al) (672)
no protection from draft
not even loss of other citizenship
The qualities of a citizen - individual and group based characteristics
foreign born residents are more likely to see citizenship when they are above the poverty line, well educated and proficient in english as a second language (673)
clearly, there is empirical support for this, but even when controlling for these factors, differences between countries (US and Canada in this case), prevail
The context of reception - national ideologies, government institutions and state policy
"Put in the language of social movement research, a country’s political opportunity structure determines access to the political system (Koopmans and Statham
1999)." (674)
that really doesn't work for Canada and the US: both are "liberal" welfare-states (Esping-Andersen 1990) and are considered "classic countries of immigration".
A Model of Structured Mobilization
the issue is: in how far the the host country's political institutions, administrative bureaucracies and integration policies facilitate or hinder immigrant citizenship.
Theoretically, this combines "new institutionalism" and social movement literatures. 
        
does that conflict, no, because:
"Yet the theoretical gap is small because the central concepts identified by McAdam, McCarthy and Zald (1996) – political opportunity structures, organizations (or “mobilizing structures”) and framing dynamics – overlap with central arguments in institutional analysis." (675)
"Does the state encourage different levels of government or private actors to support newcomers? Are there policies in place to materially affect immigrants’ ability to acquire citizenship, such as
language training? Institutions and policies affect understandings of citizenship and the ability to participate. Once mobilized, immigrants – and those opposed to their political projects – can reinforce, undermine or modify existing policies or institutional practices via feedback loops (Pierson 1993, 1994)." (677)
The Social nature of Citzenship
we know that "civic and political engagement occurs most readily through personal contact and social interaction, rather than impersonal appeals or spontaneous engagement (e.g., Gould 1995; McAdam, McCarthy and Zald 1996; Rosenstone and Hansen
1993)." (677)
        
also: "Verba and colleagues (1995) demonstrate that involvement with voluntary associations, workplaces and religious institutions teaches civic and political skills, while Putnam (2000) argues that social capital drives civic and political engagement, as well as trust in the political system." (677)
consequently, this holds for immigrants, too: "These studies focus almost exclusively on native-born citizens, but there are strong theoretical and empirical grounds to believe immigrant political
incorporation also depends on interpersonal and organizational contact." (677)
example: helping latino immigrants with filling in their application forms and studying for the civics exam (678)
The nested nature of Political Incorporation: National Policies
...
The Contours of Canadian and U.S. Policy Environments
In Canada, "Citizenship and Immigration Canada" (CIC) is a stand-alone federal department, whereas in the US the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), used to be part of the Department of Justice and is now under the Department of Homeland Security, with important substantive implications.
The CIC generally promotes citizenship and integration, whereas the INS has an ethos of law enforcement, and especially after 9/11 protection of the homeland
“The Canadian policy is that we are a country of immigration. The only way an immigrant can influence how the country is run, to do that, you need to vote. And you can only vote if you become a citizen. The Citizenship Act ensures the facilitation of citizenship, so that immigrants can exercise their voting capacity. That is the main policy thrust.” (679)
        
"In contrast, former INS Commissioner Doris Meissner describes a very different attitude, where “the dominant culture of the agency\ldots [was] rooted in a view of immigration as a source of security and law enforcement vulnerability more than of continued nation building.” (2001:2) (679) "Service functions, such as administering naturalization, often take second place
to border control (Andreas 2000; Maga\~{n}a 2003)". (679)
it should be noted that this really doesn't make a lot of sense, seeing as many terrorists are now "home-grown" - at least that is already the case in Europe and there seems to be little reason (certainly not a more relaxed citizenship regime) that this shouldn' be the case in the US, too. And this, to begin with is only when one actually subscribes to this promotion focus view of politics. (Politics of fear)
Substantive differences (assistance)
        
The American federal government provides no settlement assistance, integration program or what have you. (USCIS for short) (?!?)
Canada, by contrast, views settlement and incorporation as a public issue necessitating some government intervention, actually, through three programs: 
        
language courses
host programs with canadian volunteers
funds for community organizations
I strongly support this! - Settlement assistance, in a way, provides an incentive for assimilation! This can generally be viewed as another factor on which assimilation is contingent (Alba \& Nee 2003)
it is, in general, really stupid not to run these settlement assistance programs. They will probably pay off.
        
different policies and views on ethno/racial diversity. 
        
while both countries embrace multiculturalism, the American variant "centers on race and civil rights, while the Canadian version favors ethnicity, recognition and integration" (680)
in a way, prevention vs. promotion focus, positive or negative definition: absence from discrimination (reinforcement) vs. cherishing of diversity (has problems, too, I think, requires de-essentializing)
"Because the United States has no formal policy on immigrant diversity, the patchwork of civil rights legislation and minority policies create incentives for community leaders to define communities in racial terms (Joppke 1999; Skerry 1993)." (680)
"As Joppke suggests, “Race is different. Its content is not a positive heritage (however modified) transplanted into the new society, but the negative experience of oppression at the hands of the receiving society. Its direction is not integration into a (white) majority\ldots but restitution for harm and public existence as a protected, separate group.” (1999:143) (680)
yes! That supports my argument that race-based policies are bad! In addition, I think this should be expanded to ethnicity, too. One way of thinking about is, is, we need a positive, view (promotion focus) not negative (prevention) view on these things.
cite the above!
interestingly, Canadians use smaller granularity in defining hyphen-groups: Vietnamese-Canadians rather than Asian-Americans.
yes, this is going in the right direction - but it could still be more.
 The Mechanisms of Structured Mobilization
the above three sets of policies channel immigrants political incorporation. 
        
"We thus find that communities that receive more support – as immigrant groups in Canada do relative to those in the United States, and as refugee communities in the United States do relative to other newcomers – build larger organizational infrastructures and have more diverse sets of community organizations (Bloemraad 2005)." (682)
"Yet a dense organizational infrastructure does not automatically lead to political activity. An institutionally complete immigrant community (Breton 1964) – one that has a well-developed organizational infrastructure – might instead insulate its members from the political mainstream into ethnic “ghettos.” (682) 
        
yes, this is precisely the danger of essentializing ethnicity, even politically.
Quote the literature on Social Movements here, that should be somewhat dangerous (single-issue claims and so forth).
Empirical findings in interviews
Positive interpretive effects should be more apparent in Canada than the United States. In-depth interviews with U.S. immigrants suggest that while some new citizens strongly value political membership, many view citizenship as a means of ensuring rights, not as an invitation or responsibility to engage in decision-making. " (682)
Citizenship does not necessarily include a strong participatory element. Thien does not engage in political activities nor does he vote, “I have no time\ldots I don’t know who is good or who is bad.” (683)
In contrast, more Canadian immigrants: "They not only respect the cultures of the different community backgrounds, but they always try to develop the culture and tradition of that community more. " (683)
see again, the difference between prevention and promotion focus
        
Conclusion
"This article makes the claim that civic and political attachment is strengthened by public funding and programmatic support, and it is undermined by the absence of such support. " (684)
        
        
Comments:
could be added as another contingent factor modifying assimilation (Alba \& Nee 2003)
shows again, that all good sociology is comparative
        
Joppke about Bloemraad 2006b, a similar book:
"This book is in three ways innovative. First, it avoids the domestic navel-gazing of U.S. immigration studies through an obvious yet ingenious comparison with Canada. Second, it shows that official multiculturalism and common citizenship may very well go together, revealing Canada, and not the United States, as the leader in successful immigrant integration. Third, the book provides a compelling picture of how the state matters in making immigrants citizens. An outstanding contribution!"

So I think, Hallwirth has it wrong: inflation doesn't only arise out of higher wages, but also when there are widespread assumptions of defaults. Inflation, crucially, depends on future growth.

        
Cc this to Graff.

        
This is good.

        
Remember: how exactly does the geldmenge increase? By people taking out LOaNs! And what if they default on them?

        
What about non-optimal currency areas? Doesn't that make tax all the more necessary?

        
There are two connections between pCT and Keynes:
1) does the PCT harm consumption? (it does not, it allows for an ARBITrary savings rate. Maybe if you want more, you need a wealth tax.
2) does Keynes work? Doesn't it and Hallwirth ultimately depend on future growth?!? Does that maybe require a pCT?
3) what about optimal currency area?

abstract = {This article demonstrates that low corruption and high female representation are two characteristics of elite quality that go closely together and help make ''formal'' democracy increasingly ''effective.'' However, the quality of elites is not an inherently independent phenomenon but is shaped by a pervasive mass factor: rising self-expression values that shift cultural norms toward greater emphasis on responsive and inclusive elites. Self-expression values, in turn, tend to be strengthened by growing human resources among the masses. Considered in a comprehensive perspective, these various components are linked through the emancipative logic of Human Development: (1) human resources, (2) self-expression values, (3) elite quality, and (4) effective democracy all contribute to widen the scope of human autonomy and choice in several aspects of people's lives, including their means and skills, their norms and values, as well as their institutions and rights.

annote = {In der Einleitung zu ihrem Sammelband grenzen Goldstein und Keohane ihren Ansatz von Rationalismus, „reflectivism“ und Spieltheorie ab. Laut Goldstein und Keohane gibt es drei Arten von Ideen, die sich in Komplexit\"{a}t und Generalit\"{a}t unterscheiden: world views, principled beliefs und causal beliefs. Diese k\"{o}nnen jeweils auf drei verschiedene Weisen Einfluss nehmen. Sie ordnen die empirischen Kapitel des Buchs sowie weitere empirische Forschung in dieses Schema ein.

Goldstein, J., \& Keohane, R. O. (1993). Ideas and Foreign Policy - An Analytical Framework. In J. Goldstein \& R. O. Keohane (Eds.), Ideas and Foreign Policy - Beliefs, Institutions, and Political Change. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press. 
   * ideas = beliefs held by individuals
   * ideas = "influence policy when
      * the principled or causal beliefs they embody provide road maps that increase actors' clarity about goals or ends-means relationships
      * when they affect outcomes of strategic situations in which there is no unique equilibrium
      * and when they become embedded in political institutions" (3)
   * "ideas as well as interests have causal weight in explanations of human action" (4)
   * opposed to: ideas are unimportant, epiphenomenal "because agents correctly anticipate the results of their actions or because some selective process ensures that only agents who behave as if they were rational succeed" (4) some kind of natural selection is in place.
   * "But even if we accept the rationality premise, actions taken by human beings depend on the substantive quality of ideas, since such ideas help to clarify principles and conceptions of causal relationships, and to coordinate individual behavior. Once institutionalized, furthermore, ideas continue to guide action in the absence of costly innovation." (5)
   * On Reflectivism: (similar to constructivism, symbolic interactionism)
      * "beliefs are a central element of all research because (...) analysis turns on how 'knowledgable practices constitute subjects'. Reflectivists 'share a cognitive, intersubjective conception of process in which identities and interests are endogenous to interaction, rather than a rationalist-behavioral one in which they are exogenous.'" (5)
      * "This explains how preferences are formed and how identities are shaped"
         * Bingo! This is the exact place of pluralism vs. deliberative fora on tax. This is the kind of process I'm looking at.
      * "Reflectivist students of the impact of ideas on policy often argue that interests cannot be conceptualized apart from ideas that constitute them, and that it is therefore futile to try to distinguish interests and ideas analytically, as we seek to do. Adopting such a view, however, would foreclose the possibility of evaluating the hypothesis that ideas are hooks against our argument that they often exert a major impact on policy." (26)
   * Three Types of Beliefs
      * World Views
         * "conceptions of possibility" (8)
         * "the connections between world views and shifts in material power and interests are complex and need investigation" (8)
      * Principled Beliefs
         * right from from, just from unjust (9)
         * "mediate between world views and particular policy conclusions; they translate fundamental doctrines into guidance for contemporary human action." (9)
      * Causal Beliefs
         * "... about cause-effect relationships which derive authority from the shared consensus of recognized elites, whether they be village elders or scientists at elite institutions" (10)
   * The Impact of Ideas on Policy
      * there is no clear-cut causal connection between ideas held by policy makers and policy choices. (11)
      * It's not about inherent quallity, it's about "choices of specific ideas may simply reflect the interests of actors"
      * Weber as cited in ibid. "Not ideas, but material and ideal interests, directly govern men's conduct. Yet very frequently the 'world images' that have been created by these ideas have, like switchmen, determined the tracks along which action has been pushed by the dynamic of interest" (12)
      * "We do not suggest a theory for the creation of these switches, or even a fully worked-out model to explain the process by which ideas are selected." (12)
      * Three Pathways:
         * ideas serve as road maps
            * "... derives from the need of individuals to determine their own preferences or to understand the causal relationship between their goals and alternative strategies by which to reach those goals." (12)
            * "If actors do not know with certainty the consequences of their actions, it is the expected effects of actions that explain them. And under conditions of uncertainty, expectations depend on causal beliefs as well as on institutional arrangements for authoritative decision making." (13)
            * "In sum, when we view politics as an arena in which actors face continual uncertainties about their interests and how to maximize them, the need for ideas to act as road maps becomes apparent. Ideas serve the purpose of guiding behavior under conditions of uncertainty by stipulating causal patterns or by providing compelling ethical or moral motivations for action." (16)
         * ideas contribute to outcomes in the absence of a unique equilibrium
            * "they may serve as focal points that define cooperative solutions or act as coalitional glue to facilitate the cohesion of particular groups - which may even prevent agreement on a wider basis.
         * ideas embedded in institutions specify policy in the absence of innovation
            * "thus, from a game-theoretic perspective, ideas may be important precisely because unique predictions cannot be generated solely through an examination of interests and strategic interactions (utility functions and payoff matrices). Because almost all games with repeated play have multiple equilibria, the ideas held by players are often the key to a game's outcome" (17)
            * "in general, when institutions intervene, the impact of ideas may be prolonged for decades or even generations. In this sense, ideas can have an impact even when no one genuinely believes in them as principled or causal statements." (20)
            * 
               * Bingo for Tax! Think Income tax!
            * "Although this institutionalization may reflect the power of some idea, its existence may also reflect the interests of the powerful" (21)
               * Bingo for Tax! Think income tax!

   * Research Design:
      * H0: "variation in policy across countries, or over time, is entirely accounted for by changes in factors other than ideas." (6)
      * "We do not seek to explain the sources of these ideas; we focus on their effects" (7)
   * Note:
      * this is still methodological individualism
      * how is this not complete relativism?
      * Note the link to my PhD proposal
      * on the text, as well as on the seminar: It's a little sad that this is set in the lofty arena of IR, with no explication let alone theorizing of its (micro-?)sociological genesis. What's lacking is an application of this framework to the underbelly of the social world. By the underbelly, I mean the realms of (state) power (monopoly on the use of violence) and (social) inequality (property rights and scale-free distributions).
      * Ignoring the social (!) and cognitive psychology of ideational genesis is an equally big question. To understand "equilibria" (meaning in complex systems, not necessarily in games of individuals, maybe by 'natural selection'?) of ideas, their genesis and their persistence would be key. Without it, this is not a theory of social change.
         * maybe in particular the "principled beliefs" are lacking a theory of social change. Evolutionary anthropology, for instance (Wilkinson/Pickett) has something to offer in this regard.
      * I'm not happy about the relativism in here. You've gotta think about what's the right idea, and how ideas (ill-)serve life chances. What's the moral justification of this research?
      * Cite the research on the link between deciding and emotions. It's about the emotions, so why are they lacking?
      * Hypothesis: is there a chance that world views, principled beliefs have both collapsed, or are usurped by causal beliefs?
      * How do you become a "recognized elite" (10)? How does that social production of power happen?
      * No theory for creation of switches, or why ideas are selected. So what do you explain?
      * I am not convinced that the reflectivist critique (interests and ideas cannot be conceptualized apart) can be ignored.

        
PhD-thesis: If you look at the status quo of tax, it's screwed up and it is inconsistent with the (re)distributive goals that most people will subscribe to (survey results are difficult, though). It is also, and this is key, in violation of what seems to be a (Kaldor-Hicks-improved) habitat for the human species. So the question is, why? Maybe, one could argue (that's the H0 at the broadest level), because in a liberal democracy, (the prescriptive baseline for anything) you'll always end up here. We have this system, because it is the preferred of several imperfect ones.
Or maybe (H1), it's not inevitable. Maybe, it depends on the political process. 
Cite the literature on emotions and deciding. Also: emotions and solidarity. Get the emotions into my PhD project. 

        

        
Follow-up
[ ] get Peter Haas "epistemic communities"'
[ ] copy some parts to thesis notes
[ ] copy some parts to Offe/Europe and Mildner/Crisis piece. 

        
   * in particular "epistemic communities" (14) on Keynesian demand management, later other stuff (World Bank, pension reform, etc.)

@article{SzelenyiKostello-1996-aa,
abstract = {The article focuses on the theory of market transition. In his article on market transition, researcher Victor Nee offered a new theory of social inequality and applied it to the study of the problem of transition from state socialist redistributive economy to market capitalism. Nee claimed that the emergence of markets in state socialist redistributive economies had unexpected consequences. The most privileged stratum or class of state socialism, redistributors, lost some of their privilege, while those at the bottom of the state socialist hierarchy, the ''direct producers,'' benefited. As a result, inequality, as measured by income or access to scarce goods, was reduced. Nee's theory identified the mechanisms by which markets generated equality under redistributive systems: if wages are not administratively set, but established by transactive relations, then producers are likely to have more power; if markets operate, then human capital is likely to be rewarded more while political loyalty is likely to matter less; if there are markets in a redistributive economy, then entrepreneurship becomes an alternative avenue of socio-economic mobility. Data collected in 1985 in rural China offered support to the theory of market transition.},

Daniel Shaviro tackles these tough questions, bringing legal, economic, and political perspectives to bear on a persistent problem not often given serious attention. When Rules Change: An Economic and Political Analysis of Transition Relief and Retroactivity focuses on tax law changes to develop an in-depth understanding of the transitional issues inherent in any substantive rule change and also to advance a set of normative policy guidelines applicable to any such circumstance.

abstract = {Explores how a common approach that emphasizes the three-way interaction among increasing returns, transportation costs, and the movement of productive factors can be applied to a wide variety of issues in regional, urban, and international economics. Introduces the basic approach in the context of "regional" models in which "agriculture" is the primary sector and is immobile across locations but "manufacturing" is a sector that is subject to increasing returns and can move between regions and discusses the Dixit-Stiglitz model of monopolistic competition and its spatial implications; how interactions among increasing returns at the level of the firm, transport, costs, and factor mobility can cause spatial economic structure to emerge and change; the case of multiregional economics; and the consequences of costly agricultural transport. Considers the location of cities in a world in which everything is mobile, examining a heuristic approach to the spatial modeling of urban systems; the monocentric economy; the emergence of new cities; the evolution of a hierarchical urban system; the size of cities; and how variations in the natural landscape, such as ports and rivers, can influence urban location. Explores international trade, discussing international specialization; economic development and the spread of industry; industrial clustering; the emergence of regions of specialization in a borderless world with continuous space; and the possible interaction between international trade and the process of urbanization within nations.

abstract = {Presents a theory of potentially universal aspects in the content of human values. 10 types of values (power, achievement, hedonism, stimulation, self-direction, universalism, benevolence, tradition, conformity, and security) are distinguished by their motivational goals. The theory also postulates a structure of relations among the value types, based on the conflicts and compatibilities experienced when pursuing them. This structure permits one to relate systems of value priorities, as an integrated whole, to other variables. A new values instrument, based on the theory, is described. Evidence from 25,863 schoolteachers, university students, adults, and adolescents in 44 countries is summarized. Relations of this approach to M. Rokeach's (1973) work on values and to other theories and research on value dimensions are discussed. Application of the approach to social issues is exemplified in politics and intergroup relations.

abstract = {The association of self-rated health with mortality is well established but poorly understood. This paper provides new insights into self-rated health that help integrate information from different disciplines, both social and biological, into one unified conceptual framework. It proposes, first, a model describing the health assessment process to show how self-rated health can reflect the states of the human body and mind. Here, an analytic distinction is made between the different types of information on which people base their health assessments and the contextual frameworks in which this information is evaluated and summarized. The model helps us understand why self-ratings of health may be modified by age or culture, but still be a valid measure of health status. Second, based on the proposed model, the paper examines the association of self-rated health with mortality. The key question is, what do people know and how do they know what they know that makes self-rated health such an inclusive and universal predictor of the most absolute biological event, death. The focus is on the social and biological pathways that mediate information from the human organism to individual consciousness, thus incorporating that information into self-ratings of health. A unique source of information is provided by the bodily sensations that are directly available only to the individual him- or herself. According to recent findings in human biology, these sensations may reflect important physiological dysregulations, such as inflammatory processes. Third, the paper discusses the advantages and limitations of self-rated health as a measure of health in research and clinical practice. Future research should investigate both the logics that govern people's reasoning about their health and the physiological processes that underlie bodily feelings and sensations. Self-rated health lies at the cross-roads of culture and biology, therefore a collaborative effort between different disciplines can only improve our understanding of this key measure of health status.},

abstract = {Deliberative democrats are committed both to inclusion and to barring coercion in public discourse. Their commitment to democratic inclusion should make them sympathetic to the challenges faced by social movements. An adequate sociology of contentious public discourse, however, shows that social movements must often act coercively in order to be included. For example, they must often alter the terrain of conflict, create a crisis, pressure interlocutors to argue consistently, or compel other parties to enter social arenas of contention that they have avoided. Democratic theorists who are committed to inclusion should approve of such coercion. Under the actual circumstances movements face, there is a tension between non-coercion and democratic inclusion. This tension demonstrates the need for a democratic standard and a mode of democratic social analysis beyond those that deliberative theory offers. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Misrepresentation can happen everywhere in all of the above
Motivation matters in all of the above.
        
"They may talk                           about                         each other - to point out weaknesses in their opponents' characters or arguments - but not to each oether. This procedure obviously falls short of what many proponents of deliberative democracy have in mind. Nevertheless, it may to some extent mimic the process of genuine deliberation where the aim is to persuade the interlocutor rather than an audience. The procedure of debating one another before an audience may be compared to adversarial proceedings in the courtroom, with the jury in the role of audience, or to negative advertising, with consumers in the same role. If the audience is also the ultimate arbieter, the interchanges that take place before it can serve to weed out falsehoods and inconsistencies and thus enable it to make a good decision - assuming, of course, that it is not swept away by passion."
        
"In his speech to the electors of Bristol in 1774, Edmund Burke told them that he would not be beound by authoritative instructions:
	Your representative owes you, not his industry only, but his judgement; and he betrays instead of serving you, if he sacrifices it to your opinion. ... Parliament is not a congress of ambassadors from different and hostile interests; which interests each must maintain, as an agent and advocate, against other agents and advocates, but parliament is a deliberative assembly of one nation, with one interest, that of the whole; where, not local purposes, not local prejudices ought to guide, but the general good, resulting from the general reason of the whole."
This speech remains, probably, the most famous statement of the case for deliberative democracy.
        
"In his essay, Gambetta draws an analogy between political and scientific deliberation, arguing that they are sustained by similar processes and values. While not disagreeing with anything he says, I would also point to some disanalogies. In sicence, there is a fact of the matter that one can get right. In political deliberation, to the extent that it concerns ultimate ends, this is not obviously the case. To the extent that the object of deliberation is to get factual beliefs right, the analogy is closer. yet even then the criteria for belief formation are less stringent in politics than in science. A better analogy might be engineering rather than science: the aim is to find an approximation that works rather than the truth. That difference is related to a further disanalogy, which is that political deliberation is constrained by the need to make a decision. Whereas scientists can wait for decades and science can wait for centuries, politicians are typically subjectot strong time constraints, in two different senses. On the one hand, important decisions tend to be so urgent that one cannot afford to discuss them indefinetely. On the other hand, less important decisions do not justify lenghty deliberations. As I observed earlier, the importance of time in political life implies that, in addition to deliberation, voting as well as bargaining inevitably has some part to play.},

Given the endemic uncertainty, the paucity of reliable data, and the absence of knowledge, it is, on average, better to do small rather than large projects, tap the dispersed information of people in the field, try tiny experiments, and learn from experience. For all this the incremental, implementing, field-oriented world of analysts is superior. The perational style of the analyst is also morally desirable in that it favors modest improvement over calamity. It leaves many moderately better off and few worse off. 'Steady as she goes' may not be as glamorous as 'full speed ahead', but it is protective of mankind's modest capacity for virtue disciplined by intelligence. It is in this dual sense - working within the limits not only of mankind's cognitive but also its moral capacities - that policy analysis is profoundly conservative"

Organizational employees (N = 466) completed measures of burnout and 6 areas of worklife at 2 times with a 1-year interval. Those people who showed an inconsistent pattern at Time 1 were more likely to change over the year than were those who did not. Among this group, those who also displayed a workplace incongruity in the area of fairness moved to burnout at Time 2, while those without this incongruity moved toward engagement. The implications of these 2 predictive indicators are discussed in terms of the enhanced ability to customize interventions for targeted groups within the workplace.},

A theoretical approach to scaling reforms has been undertaken by Hall (1993). He proposes a three-level classification: talking of first-order changes, when only the adjustment (of the policy instrument) is changed; second-order, changes if the policy instrument itself changes; and finally third-order changes, when not only policy instruments but also the key objectives/goals are changed. He argues that the fmal 'wholesale changes in policy occur relatively rarely, but when they do occur as a result of reflection on past experience, we can describe them as instances of third order change' (Hall 1993:279).

annote = {Very good, instructive metaphor:
        
   * It's all about reacting to change.
      * Monetary union: reacting to the business cycle
      * Political union: making political decisions.
        
Suggests as criterion for optimality: "Je dichter und solidarischer die grenz\"{u}berschreitenden Beziehungen zwischen den EU-Gesellschaften und ihren Bev\"{o}lkerungen, desto optimaler der Integrationsraum." (197)
        
        
Here's a very basic thought. Delhey may be right about sozial intergation, but: there needs to be fairly litte inequality. Gross inequality corrodes social relationships and it corrodes trust. The same holds for solidarity.
        
        
        
Delhey mentions on 208 the main drivers of dyadic trust: SES/Modernisation (Inglehart!) and small-is-beautiful. This is because, we know it, societies trust more as their countries become richer and more developed. This is the Human Development Sequenec story we know it well. However, Delhey forgets one thing: this also holds at the individual level. The more affluent an individual, the more trusting/trustworthy. And maybe (Wilksinon/Pickett?) the same even holds for distribution and relative inequality per se. (The evolutionary logic of cooperation certainly suggests that).
        
        
        
There's another issue where system and social integration are interdependent: the welfare state. System integration is actually not complete: it does not feature the welfare state institutions, or, indeed any redistributive intervention. Redistribution, so far, happens as a function of economic integration, largely unmanaged. It is clear from a political economy point of view that redistribution within one country (already!) implies a level of redistribution between countries as well. The current trade-off between the two is tacit, and haphazard, not deliberate, let alone deliberated. To get to a deliberated tradeoff between the two, we need trust and solidarity. If this is, in fact, in part a prisoners dilemma, we need trust all the more. That's the link that Delhey missed, unfortunately.
        
        
        
But there's more: absent this degree of systems integration, social integration may in itself suffer: because inequities may be growing. There's a circularly reinforcing causality here. So no (as Delhey also says, but for different reasons): European Integration cannot succeed absent further social integration cum system integration (welfare state).

abstract = {Comparative research on happiness typically focuses on the level of happiness in nations, which is measured using the mean. There have also been attempts to compare inequality of happiness in nations and this is measured using the standard deviation. There is doubt about the appropriateness of that latter statistic and some prefer to use the statistics currently used to compare income inequality in nations, in particular the Gini coefficient. In this paper, we review the descriptive statistics that can be used to quantify inequality of happiness in nations. This review involves five steps: (1) we consider how happiness nations is assessed, (2) next we list the statistics of dispersion and considered their underlying assumptions; (3) we construct hypothetical distributions that cover our notion of inequality; (4) we define criteria of performance and (5) we check how well the step-2 statistics meet the step-4 demands when applied to the step-3 hypothetical distributions. We then applied the best performing statistics to real distributions of happiness in nations. Of the nine statistics considered, five failed this empirical test. One of the failed statistics is the Gini coefficient. Its malfunction was foreseen on theoretical grounds: the Gini coefficient assumes a ratio level of measurement, while happiness measures can at best be treated at the interval level. The Gini coefficient has been designed for application to 'capacity' variables such as income rather than to 'intensity' variables such as happiness. Four statistics proved to be satisfactory; these were (1) the standard deviation, (2) the mean absolute difference, (3) the mean pair difference and (4) the interquartile range. Since all four, statistics performed about equally well, there is no reason to discontinue the use of the standard deviation when quantifying inequality of happiness in nations.

political theory (Fishkin, 1992). But why not move beyond armchair
empiricism? If a counterfactual situation is morally relevant, why not do a
real social science experiment to see what the appropriate counterfactual
might actually look like? And if that counterfactual is both discoverable
and normatively relevant, why not then let the rest of the world know
about it?

abstract = {Over the past decade, there has been a resurgence of interest and research into the connections between associations and democracy. This article divides the question of associative contributions to democracy into four component parts: What (a) contributions do (b) different kinds of associations make to advance (c) contesting ideals of democratic governance in various (d ) political contexts? Associations enhance democracy in at least six ways: through the intrinsic value of associative life, fostering civic virtues and teaching political skills, offering resistance to power and checking government, improving the quality and equality of representation, facilitating public deliberation, and creating opportunities for citizens and groups to participate directly in governance. These contributions are not all mutually consonant with one another, and different forms of associations are better suited to advance some contributions than others. Furthermore, those who propose bolstering associations as a strategy for revitalizing democracy frequently have quite different ideals of democracy in mind. The forms and contributions of associations appropriate to three contesting notions of democratic governance--liberal minimalism, conventional representation-cum-administration, and participatory democracy--are also discussed. Finally, the democratic priority of associative contributions depends crucially on contextual features of particular societies. Under tyrannical regimes, for example, associations that resist government authority are more crucial than those that foster compliance and respect for political institutions.

Remember 2 discuss greater fool redistribtion in bubbles. Also: non-recpiurse, neg amortization, kickback and liar loans. Bubble was at several levels: real estate and securitisation. Note: non recourse no down payment is an OPTION actually!
                  
Random Note:        
Keynesians are concerned with the demand side. That works in the short term. In the short term, in a downturn, youve got excess capacity, NOT a supply side problem. However, in the long term, you want aggregate supply to increase, which is inelastic in the short term, but can shift to the right in the long term. But this dichotomy is overstated: if you fuck up in the short term, you screw the long term (you stay under the long-run growth potential). Synthesis: stimulus measures should maximize investment, not spending; these are not the same. 
Think hard about consumption vs. investment; you will have both because of the stimulus multiplier, which is fine, you just don't want too much of it.},

	\%consider doing logarithmic or polynomial correltion for any non-linear effect. That is in fact what I assume: that it IS non-linear
	\%711: ``It is important not to read too much into these correlations. For one thing, it is clear that even a strong correlation does not imply causality. Moreover other med- iating factors in reported life satisfaction are left out of the analysis here. The literature on wellbeing is clear that family, friendship, trust in one’s neighbours, security, meaningful work, and a sense of purpose are all important correlates of subjective wellbeing (Helliwell 2003, Layard 2005, Dolan et al. 2006). None of these is necessarily mediated by consumption expenditure.''
	\%712: `Nonetheless, it is clear that certain kinds of human tendencies – the pursuit of status, social belonging, identity and meaning, for example – are (in the modern society at least) strongly mediated by material goods and services. Possessions confer status, solidity and meaning to our lives, provide access to the social world and facilitate participation in the creation of that world (Douglas 2006 [1976]). To the extent that this is so, consuming “comes naturally” to the human species, whereas, as Dawkins (2001) has pointed out, sustainability does not.''
	\%713: ``Recent evidence has shown how closely health and wellbeing are related to social status even in developed countries (Wilkinson 2000, 2005, Marmot 2005, Marmot and Wilkinson 2005). This would suggest that beyond the economy of consump- tion lies an “economy of wellbeing”. It may not pay to increase consumption in the aggregate, but it pays to be at the top of the pile when consumption is unequally distributed. Evidence''
	\%713: ``This positional pathology is exacerbated by another psycho-social phenomenon affecting subjective wellbeing, that of “hedonic adaptation” (Lyubomirsky et al. 2005). As I get richer, I simply become more accustomed to the pleasure of the goods and services my new income affords me. And if I want to maintain the same level of happiness, I must achieve ever higher levels of income in the future just to stay in the same place. A related understanding of human psychology becomes relevant here: in a society where visible signals of excess surround us on every side, the potential discrepancy between what we have and what we would like to have grows ever larger. Even as we chase after the most recent symbols of success, the frontier of success is moving ahead of us. Research supports the idea that this kind of discrepancy between our aspirations and the reality of our lives is psychologically damaging to our quality of life (Michalos 1985, Higgins 1987).''},

abstract = {International research on the social determinants of health has increasingly started to integrate a welfare state regimes perspective. Although this is to be welcomed, to date there has been an over-reliance on Esping-Andersen's The three worlds of welfare capitalism typology (1990). This is despite the fact that it has been subjected to extensive criticism and that there are in fact a number of competing welfare state typologies within the comparative social policy literature. The purpose of this paper is to provide public health researchers with an up-to-date overview of the welfare state regime literature so that it can be reflected more accurately in future research. It outlines The three worlds of welfare capitalism typology, and it presents the criticisms it received and an overview of alternative welfare state typologies. It concludes by suggesting new avenues of study in public health that could be explored by drawing upon this broader welfare state regimes literature.},

abstract = {Trust pervades human societies. Trust is indispensable in friendship, love, families and organizations, and plays a key role in economic exchange and politics. In the absence of trust among trading partners, market transactions break down. In the absence of trust in a country's institutions and leaders, political legitimacy breaks down. Much recent evidence indicates that trust contributes to economic, political and social success. Little is known, however, about the biological basis of trust among humans. Here we show that intranasal administration of oxytocin, a neuropeptide that plays a key role in social attachment and affiliation in non-human mammals, causes a substantial increase in trust among humans, thereby greatly increasing the benefits from social interactions. We also show that the effect of oxytocin on trust is not due to a general increase in the readiness to bear risks. On the contrary, oxytocin specifically affects an individual's willingness to accept social risks arising through interpersonal interactions. These results concur with animal research suggesting an essential role for oxytocin as a biological basis of prosocial approach behaviour.},

annote = {   * "Our contention here is that ideas shape how we understand political problems, give definition to our goals and strategies, and are the currency we use to communicate about politics. By giving definition to our values and preferences, ideas provide us with interpretive frameworks that make us see some facts as important and others as less so." (1)
   * "... this theoretical approach is dynamic rather than linear, and iterative rather than mechanical. Ideas are constantly in flux, being reconsidered and redefined as actors communicate and debate with one another"
   * "Ideas are causal beliefs" (1)
      * products of cognition
      * "connections between things and people in the world" 
         * formal and informal
      * guides for action
   * Streams of Ideational Research
      * =/ Behaviorism "derided interpretive methods of inquiry for being less empirically rigorous than deductive methods" (5)
      * =/ (neo-)Marxist "modes of inquiry that, though more receptive to interpretive methods, where sharply dismissive of non-materialist explanations of human action.
      * cultural/historical/rational choice institutionalisms (...) turned to ideas to explain specific phenomena such approaches could not explain alone. (6)
      * political sociology moved beyond systems theory and reevaluated the role of culture in politics (6)
      * "policy analysis witnessed the development of new scholarship on issues like agenda setting and problem definition that helped move ideational analysis back to the center of policy studies" (7)
      * "field of IR witnessed the development of an increasingly influential constructivist school that emphasized the structuring role of ideas, discourse and culture in foreign policy" (8)
   * Common Ground and Ongoing Debates
        
      * Common Themes
         * "ideas are the foundation of institutions. As ideas give rise to peoples' actions, and as those actions form routines, the results are social institutions. The ideas then are enshrined in the institutions. As people interact with institutions, the founding ideas are reproduced." (10)
            * "ideas provide elegant linkages between institutions and political processes,
         * "relationship between ideas and interests, namely, that interests are one form of idea" (11)
            * "Ideas are cluster concepts (...), embrace thoughts, emotions, desires, as well as interests, all in delicate and fluid balance with one another."
               * how does this help? It's rephrasing the question. Compare this to Tversky and Kahnemann, that's a theory!
         * (radical) political and policy change
            * "radical change (...) problematizes radical change as a response to new perceptions and ways of thinking." (13)
            * "what things change and how they change are all the result of what people chose to do in response to the world in which they find themselves. (...) " (14)
      * Unresolved Debates and Tensions
         * Ontology: "the social world is constructed" (16)
         * Epistemology: how to see and track down an idea?

               * linked to measurable, specific outcome
            * problem: ideas that no one utters.
      * The Methods of Ideational Analysis
         * "Case selection can allow one to isolate ideas in a process of change" (Parsons ibid. on EU supranational institutions).
         * Select more on the IV (21)
         * 
   * Questions
      * Questions about the "deeper" idea? Can there be more or less accurate ideas?

abstract = {Pelkmans ndash; European Integration: Methods and Economic Analysis, Third edition'The bible of European economic integration studies.' Professor Hiromasa Kubo, President of the EU Institute, Kobe University, Japan'This text is very well researched and the author displays an excellent knowledge of the EU both at an institutional level and at an economic analysis level.'Dr Adrian Gourlay, Loughborough University Written by one of Europe's leading EU economic analysts, this third edition of European Integration has been significantly reorganised in structure, fully revised, and updated to reflect the changes in the European Union over recent years.The book offers a fundamental discussion and detailed analysis of European integration. Uniquely, it combines economic analysis with a detailed knowledge of the integration methods employed in the EU. Whilst being academically rigorous and assuming some prior knowledge, it is full of practical examples and case studies, enabling students to bridge the gap between theory and policy practice. Key features Unique integration of economic theory with EU regulatory and policy framework. Non-mathematical treatment of economic theory - which is presented using graphical, non-algebraic tools. Innovative analysis of the economics of subsidiarity, EU regulation, the economic constitution of the Union, services market integration and the EU budget. Numerous case studies and practical examples included throughout. New to the third edition Fully updated - now including a more extensive economic analysis of monetary union, the euro, and monetary and fiscal policy in the eurozone. Updated coverage of the economic and strategic issues of enlargement in the EU-25, soon to be EU-27, and beyond. New chapters on 'The Economics of EU Regulation' and 'Assessing the EU Budget'. Revised and extended treatment of economic cohesion (convergence and divergence) and EU social policy and reforms. Updated coverage of the internal market for network industries and the Bolkestein directive on horizontal liberalisation of services, plus a deeper economic analysis of pro-competitive effects of the single market. Includes new examples on recent issues, and cases that have been revised and deepened analytically. AudienceEuropean Integration is an intermediate level text which has been carefully designed to appeal to a wide range of students studying economic integration as part of an economics, business, law or public administration degree.AuthorJacques Pelkmans is Jan Tinbergen Chair for European Economics and Director of the Department of European Economic Studies at the College of Europe in Bruges. He is also a Council Member of the WRR in The Hague (an independent think-tank, attached to the Prime Minister's office) and Associate Fellow of the Centre for European Policy Studies (CEPS) in Brussels.},

abstract = {It is said that inequality is returning to modern nations and that this is manifest in the widening disparities in income in the late 20th century. This trend is attributed to neo-liberalism, globalisation and immigration, and is seen as a turn in the long-term trend towards a more civilised society. In this paper I challenge the idea of rising inequality. I argue that income difference falls short as an indicator of inequality and cannot be meaningfully compared across time. Instead I propose to measure inequality in another way, not by difference in presumed chances for a good life, but by the dispersion of actual outcomes of life, using the standard deviation of life-satisfaction as an indicator. Comparison across time in EU nations over the years 1973-2001 shows that the dispersion of life-satisfaction became smaller instead of larger. Comparison across 80 nations in the 1990s also shows lower dispersion in the most modern countries. So the trend towards greater equality seems to persist. If there is any truth in the theory that access to scarce resources has become more unequal, the tendency must have been compensated in some way, possibly by greater equality in personal capabilities.

Class Notes

        
   * Olaf says: it's kind of like social integration (CME) and system integration (LME) in sociology.
      * Olaf says: if you believe that society should form common norms and some degree of integration, than you really should be more in favor of the CME. (?!?)
   * Olaf is of course right, Hall + Soskice is a functionalist argument, not a conflict approach.
      * This may be a very productive prism to look through for my thesis. Let's look at arguments for/against the tax, looking through conflict, functionalism etc.
      * (This would be my first order question: what kind of arguments to people make, based on what kind of epistemology? (functionalism, etc.) I could prime them with these frameworks, including an elaborated version of Hall/Soskice.
      * The second order question would be: how come that experts use these, and not other epistemologies?
   * Here's another thought: Hall and Soskice don't feature power, or "exploitation", maybe because their "strategic" orientation on firms implies that a firm is always a positive sum proposition, never a zero-sum proposition. Of course if it were zero-sum, there wouldn't be coordination problem. If you have power, you don't need to cooperate/coordinate.
   * Think hard about whether Hall and Soskice can, in fact, be treated independent of distributive outcomes.
   * notice that by engaging Hall and Soskice, I complicate my (stupid) dichotomy between (welfare) state and market: it becomes a question of endogeneity and of equilibrium.
   * 
      * choosing LME or CME then becomes a second order question that may or may not depend on what kind of welfare state you have and/or can provide. This is key!
   * also note that Hall and Soskice is an actor-centered theory, firms are actors. So this depends on the genesis of the firm! why do we have a corporation?

@article{AldersonNielsen-2002-aa,
abstract = {The debate on the resurgence of income inequality in some advanced industrial societies has often focused on the impact of an increasingly integrated world economy, typified by growing capital mobility, heightened international competition, and an increase in migration. This study represents one of the first systematic, cross-national examinations of the role of globalization in the inequality ''U-turn.'' Results indicate, on the one hand, that total inequality variation is principally affected by the percentage of the labor force in agriculture, followed by the institutional factors union density and decommodification, and only then by globalization. On the other hand, longitudinal variation in inequality, while still dominated by the percentage of the labor force in agriculture, is also principally affected by aspects of globalization, such as southern import penetration and direct investment outflow, and to a lesser extent by migration. In other words, globalization explains the longitudinal trend of increasing inequality that took place within many industrial countries better than it does cross-sectional inequality differences among countries.

@article{DingwerthPattberg-2006-aa,
abstract = {In one of the first issues of Global Governance, Larry Finkelstein observed that ''Global Governance' appears to be virtually anything'. A decade later, the concept of global governance has become ever more popular--and confusion about its meaning ever greater. While we do think that some flexibility in the use of concepts is both theoretically desirable and practically unavoidable, we believe that the current disarray is a hindrance to more fruitful discussions and to the goal of developing more coherent theories of global governance. We therefore argue that a more careful use of the term global governance is necessary to overcome the current confusion spawned by the variation in uses of the concept. After clarifying the basic function of concepts in social science and reviewing the different uses of global governance in the current literature, we use the term as an analytical concept that provides a perspective on world politics different from the more traditional notion of 'international relations'.

wow. "It can indeed be shown (...) that majority rule is generally not welfare-maximizing if individual voters are assumed to be rational self-interest maximizers. (20)

        
The EU is a regulatory state, says Scharpf and Majone (21)

        
Read Levi 1988
Read Riker 1982

        
Scharpf (31) actually advocates consumption taxation, but he may have it a bit confused. Just moving to consumption tax doesn't help. It depends on which kind. A VAT, proportional consumption tax will actually still burden labor disproportionalte.

        
Scharpf also promotes (31) the negative income tax.

        
Figure out who cited Scharpf 1997.

abstract = {Cooperation and competition are two basic modes of social cognition that necessitate monitoring of both one's own and others' actions, as well as adopting a specific mental set. In this fMRI, study individuals played a specially designed computer game, according to a set of predefined rules, either in cooperation with or in competition against another person. The hemodynamic response during these conditions was contrasted to that of the same subjects playing the game independently. Both cooperation and competition stances resulted in activation of a common frontoparietal network subserving executive functions, as well as the anterior insula, involved in autonomic arousal. Moreover, distinct regions were found to be selectively associated with cooperation and competition, notably the orbitofrontal cortex in the former and the inferior parietal and medial prefrontal cortices in the latter. This pattern reflects the different mental frameworks implicated in being cooperative versus competitive with another person. In accordance with evidence from evolutionary psychology as well as from developmental psychology, we argue that cooperation is a socially rewarding process and is associated with specific left medial orbitofrontal cortex involvement.},

So interestingly, Somin thinkgs that deliberative democracy cannot overcome the logic of rational irrationality 260.
        
Think deeply and comment on how deliberative democracy departs from rational choice. Why would people ever contribute and extent the effort to understand if there were utility maximizers? There are not!
        
        
Somin's skepticism that deliberative democracy may only make rational irrationality wors (265) depends on her rejection of deliberative ds. central tenet: that we CAN get all intersubjective.
this is self-evident if, and only if human beings really are utility maximizers.
They may not be.
Or more specifically, we may GET Them to overcome this.
They may have the capacity for something greater.
        
        
To argue against the infinite regress critique here (I can't say that Somin is wrong if people in a deliberation choose to be that way, or if Somin were to say that her position is a deliberative one) - I have the Fung argument for revolution: as long as they play foul, so can the proponents of DD>},

*  All of the links are empirically confired: more open economies have lower CIT, countries that consume more in government, have higher CIT, size of country, however des not appear to matter
* Note: in emergeing and developing countries the impact of taxes on FDI is small, compared to quality of governance, business climate, infrastructure and distance to end markets as well as labror costs
* however, as they show on page 10: given equal levels of governance, tax matters an aweful lot. IT's like a necessary vs. sufficient condition.
* as of today, compared to the past, tax revenues have NOT fallen, but in fact stayed constant. Of course if you control for growth, or a proper counteraactual, this finding disapperas. The revenue maximizing rate for corporate tax rates may be in a parabolic relationship and is estimated to be somewhere between 26 and 32\%. (12) That's the figure for western europe, it's likely to be much lower at 17.6 or so in Eastern europe
* they also write that CIT and PIT go hand in hand and a re likely to do so in the future (14)
* they write it on 16: optimal tax literature suggests that overall deadweight costs of taxation and thus economic efficiency is generally higher if taxes are levied on most inelastic cash flows and least mobile bases, such as labor, consumption and real estate. 
* Think this through for progressive consumption: isn't that wrong? Because in progressive consumption, there IS NO deadweight loss, unless you accept that people really get welfare from the S-class which isn't merely positional.

        Reading Critique 9
        
Reading: Bloemraad 2006, Van Hook et al. 2006
Additional Reading: Bloemraad 2006

        
In her 2006 book, Bloemraad argues that „civic and political attachment is strengthened by public funding and programmatic support, and it is undermined by the absence of such support“ (684).
Her argument, comparing the situation in Canada and the US first of all shows again how “all good sociology is comparative” (Bean 2008, in class). She shows convincingly how several reasons other than a changed cost-benefit rationale, qualities of the citizens or (ideological) context of reception affect the different naturalization rates in Canada and the US. 
I find particularly interesting the relation she draws to the institutional setup in the United States, where the Immigration and Naturalization Services (INS) were previously part of the Department of Justice and are now subsumed under the newly created post-9/11 Department of Homeland Security, whereas in Canada Immigration services are a government department of its own. This organizational bias towards homeland security is also reflected in the organizational culture of the INS, which Bloemraad reports to be overwhelmingly concerned with the prevention of terrorism and law enforcement.
In a way, naturalization, or more broadly speaking, immigration in the US is governed by system that is defined in negative terms: by a stress on the absence of security risks, whereas in Canada, the state role in immigration is defined in positive terms of facilitating settlement, political activity, and, ultimately, citizenship. 
It may be instructive to draw an admittedly bold analogy to the individual level work on regulatory focus theory in social psychology (Higgins et al. 2001), where the US, negatively defined system would be the “prevention focus” equivalent and the Canadian positively defined system the “promotion focus”. Without taking this analogy too far, one way of reading Bloemraads argument and her empirical support would in fact be to assume that the US system does bring immigrants into a “promotion focus”, where they are, as is the case in the presented interview, focused on maintaining the status quo and avoiding threats and risks. Assimilation, integration, and maybe in particular gaining citizenship are of course activities, I am sure Higgins et al (2001) would agree, that require a promotion focus, where people concentrate on rewards, rather then threats.

flypaper theory of tax: taxing corporations is stupid. but it's also necessary. but people like it (ARlen and Weiss 1994, as cited in McCaffery Baron 2003: 7)

biases in people’s understanding of and attitudes about tax. The general complexity of

        
the subject matter, the low benefits for any individual to obtain on a personal level from

        
fully understanding it, the absence of any general, widely available mechanism to debias

Professor Hiromasa Kubo, President of the EU Institute, Kobe University, Japan'This text is very well researched and the author displays an excellent knowledge of the EU both at an institutional level and at an economic analysis level.'Dr Adrian Gourlay, Loughborough University Written by one of Europe's leading EU economic analysts, this third edition of European Integration has been significantly reorganised in structure, fully revised, and updated to reflect the changes in the European Union over recent years.The book offers a fundamental discussion and detailed analysis of European integration. Uniquely, it combines economic analysis with a detailed knowledge of the integration methods employed in the EU. Whilst being academically rigorous and assuming some prior knowledge, it is full of practical examples and case studies, enabling students to bridge the gap between theory and policy practice. Key features Unique integration of economic theory with EU regulatory and policy framework. Non-mathematical treatment of economic theory - which is presented using graphical, non-algebraic tools. Innovative analysis of the economics of subsidiarity, EU regulation, the economic constitution of the Union, services market integration and the EU budget. Numerous case studies and practical examples included throughout. New to the third edition Fully updated - now including a more extensive economic analysis of monetary union, the euro, and monetary and fiscal policy in the eurozone. Updated coverage of the economic and strategic issues of enlargement in the EU-25, soon to be EU-27, and beyond. New chapters on 'The Economics of EU Regulation' and 'Assessing the EU Budget'. Revised and extended treatment of economic cohesion (convergence and divergence) and EU social policy and reforms. Updated coverage of the internal market for network industries and the Bolkestein directive on horizontal liberalisation of services, plus a deeper economic analysis of pro-competitive effects of the single market. Includes new examples on recent issues, and cases that have been revised and deepened analytically. AudienceEuropean Integration is an intermediate level text which has been carefully designed to appeal to a wide range of students studying economic integration as part of an economics, business, law or public administration degree.AuthorJacques Pelkmans is Jan Tinbergen Chair for European Economics and Director of the Department of European Economic Studies at the College of Europe in Bruges. He is also a Council Member of the WRR in The Hague (an independent think-tank, attached to the Prime Minister's office) and Associate Fellow of the Centre for European Policy Studies (CEPS) in Brussels.},

abstract = {In the spirit of Alvin Toffler’s Future Shock, a social critique of our obsession with choice, and how it contributes to anxiety, dissatisfaction and regret. This paperback includes a new P.S. section with author interviews, insights, features, suggested readings, and more. Whether we’re buying a pair of jeans, ordering a cup of coffee, selecting a long-distance carrier, applying to college, choosing a doctor, or setting up a 401(k), everyday decisions--both big and small--have become increasingly complex due to the overwhelming abundance of choice with which we are presented.We assume that more choice means better options and greater satisfaction. But beware of excessive choice: choice overload can make you question the decisions you make before you even make them, it can set you up for unrealistically high expectations, and it can make you blame yourself for any and all failures. In the long run, this can lead to decision-making paralysis, anxiety, and perpetual stress. And, in a culture that tells us that there is no excuse for falling short of perfection when your options are limitless, too much choice can lead to clinical depression.In The Paradox of Choice, Barry Schwartz explains at what point choice--the hallmark of individual freedom and self-determination that we so cherish--becomes detrimental to our psychological and emotional well-being. In accessible, engaging, and anecdotal prose, Schwartz shows how the dramatic explosion in choice--from the mundane to the profound challenges of balancing career, family, and individual needs--has paradoxically become a problem instead of a solution. Schwartz also shows how our obsession with choice encourages us to seek that which makes us feel worse.By synthesizing current research in the social sciences, Schwartz makes the counterintuitive case that eliminating choices can greatly reduce the stress, anxiety, and busyness of our lives. He offers eleven practical steps on how to limit choices to a manageable number, have the discipline to focus on the important ones and ignore the rest, and ultimately derive greater satisfaction from the choices you have to make.},

There are several problems with these guys. 
        
        
1) they do income inequality without economics, let alone political economy. They ignore the counterfactual and the degrees of distributive freedom that states have. More specifically, growth and debt are not in the picture: at which price do states still get to redistribute? At the price of growth? At the price of a squeezed middle class? at the price of high debt or structural unemployment?
2) they massage the data (they used and unweighted average for within-country inequalities) to argue that the overall gini  has marginally sunk (the big countries like germany and the UK are not weighed) (255)
        
        
3) when they argue that welfare states are still potent, they cite DE and NL and cite that while gross wages (!) for full time (!) employed (!) inequality increased, net incomes decreased in inequality. This of course is bullshit: the big question is wages vs. capital incomes, full-time/vs/ part time, employed vs. unemployed. This is all256
        
        
The exercise of subjective understanding (wahrnehmung) of income inequalities seems somewhat preposterous: exactly what does it matter whether people compare their incomes to reference groups (people of similar age and education) in their own country or abroad? Is that really all we have to say about inequality, that is, whether people notice they're being screwed? This much is sure; as a function of IPE, these incomes are related. So what does it matter whether people understand it or not? this is naturalizing false class consciousness, if you wish. I am uncertain about the analytical value of this enterprise, but disappointed by their half-assed humanistic impetus. 262
        
        
4) they use MLD (mittlere logarithmise abweichung), as they admit, has greater "bottom sensitivyt" (263), also known as: distributing between the poor and the middle class. Is that the question? based on which normative assumption?

Abstract

        

        
"This article provides a summary of empirical research on groupthink theory. Groupthink research, including analyses of historical cases of poor group decision making and laboratory tests of groupthink, is reviewed. Results from these two research areas are briefly compared. Theoretical and methodological issues for future groupthink research are identified and discussed. I conclude that groupthink research has had and continues to have considerable heuristic value. A small, but growing, body of empirical literature has been generated. In addition, groupthink research has stimulated a number of theoretical ideas, most of which have yet to be tested." (116)

        

        
This paper is essentially a (non-quantitative) meta-analysis or research review.
More on Groupthink (fun stuff)

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink
instructional video by commercial human resources consultancy: somewhat simplified
Scene supposedly featuring groupthink from the movie "Outbreak" (1995): more entertaining than analytical, but, as I said in class a couple of times, I just love examples.

        

        

        

        

        
Notes
Janis (1972) idea of groupthink became very popular, both in academia and beyond (management), but empirical research has not kept up with this popularity.
The existing research provide only partial support or are somewhat inconclusive (117).
Original Research (Janis 1972)
Janis (1972) originally suggested four antecedents to groupthink ... 
cohesion
insulation
lack of impartial leadership
lack of methodical decision-making procedures
(member homogeneity) (Janis 1982 as cited in ibid.)
(high stress) (Janis 1982 as cited in ibid.)
and provided case study evidence from
Bay of Pigs (+)
North Korea (+)
Pearl Harbor (+)
Viet Nam (+)
Marshall Plan (-)
Missile Crisis (-)
(Watergate) (Janis 1982 as cited in ibid.) (+)
described eight groupthink symptoms
Illusions of invulnerability creating excessive optimism and encouraging risk taking.
Rationalising warnings that might challenge the group's assumptions.
Unquestioned belief in the morality of the group, causing members to ignore the consequences of their actions.
Stereotyping those who are opposed to the group as weak, evil, disfigured, impotent, or stupid.
Direct pressure (on dissenters) to conform placed on any member who questions the group, couched in terms of "disloyalty".
Self censorship of ideas that deviate from the apparent group consensus.
Illusions of unanimity among group members, silence is viewed as agreement.
Mindguards — self-appointed members who shield the group from dissenting information. (source, changed somewhat)
and seven symptoms of a poor decision-making process
"incomplete survey of alternatives
failure to reappraise alternatives
poor information search
selective bias in processing information" (119)
additionally, Janis (1972: 209pp. as cited in ibid.) suggested seven ways to prevent ways of groupthink
Leaders should assign each member the role of “critical evaluator”. This allows each member to freely air objections and doubts.
Higher-ups should not express an opinion when assigning a task to a group.
The organization should set up several independent groups, working on the same problem.
All effective alternatives should be examined.
Each member should discuss the group's ideas with trusted people outside of the group.
The group should invite outside experts into meetings. Group members should be allowed to discuss with and question the outside experts.
At least one group member should be assigned the role of Devil's advocate. This should be a different person for each meeting. (source)
Historical Cases: Debate and Other Research
Some discussion (particularly with Raven 1974 as cited in ibid.) arose on whether member homogeneity was conceptually useful and whether it could be found in all cases (Watergate). Raven (1974 as cited in ibid.) maintained that rather than homogeneity, loyalty to the leader (Nixon) caused groupthink.
Tetlock (1979 as cited in ibid.: 123) also found that groupthink was associated with more simplistic statements, more positive in-group references, but could find no indications for more negative out-group references.
McCauley (1989 as cited in ibid.: 124) suggested a social-influence extension to groupthink by introducing two more aspects of groupthink; the personal orientation of member as being either compliant ("public agreement with majority position without private acceptance", ibid: 124) or internalizing ("private acceptance", ibid: 124). Janis (1982, as cited in ibid: 124), again thought that internalization was always a feature of groupthink.
Tetlock et al. (1992 as cited in ibid.) presented empirical findings that included no support for "group cohesiveness" and "high stress"
Hensley \& Griffin (1986 as cited in ibid). complicate the research design to make it more strictly comparative and suggest three further symptoms of poor decision-making that could lead to groupthink:
"failure to initiate or maintain contact with opposition group
lack of cooperation with third party mediators
failure to extend the time period for reaching a decision" (ibid: 124f.)
Experimental Designs
Cohesiveness
Leana (1985 as cited in ibid.: 127) found that - counter to the theory - members of noncohesive groups exhibited more self-censorship. No other significant associations with cohesion were found.
Generally, very little, disconfirming or inconclusive evidence on cohesiveness.
Group Insulation
Moorhead \& Montanari (1986 as cited in ibid: 131) find that insulated groups consider fewer alternatives, but also feel vulnerable and consult more experts (!).
Lack of Impartial Leadership: (relatively) consistent
Lack of Methodical Decision Making Procedure: mostly supportive
Laboratory Studies Involving Additional Issues
Callaway et al. (1985 as cited in ibid: 132) find that groupthink groups have more state anxiety, somewhat in contradiction of Janis (1972, as cited in ibid.) who suggests that groups revert to groupthink conditions to suppress critical inquiry.
Callaway et al. (1985 as cited in ibid: 132) also found that dominant members made better decisions and experienced less anxiety; bottom line: many dominant members are good, one is really bad?
Research Agenda
What are groupthink situations?
Collective avoidance
"is conducive to the stress-induced defensive reaction to potential failure in a crisis described by Janis (1972)" (as cited in ibid.: 135)
might be alleviated by stressing accountability
Collective overoptimism
"is characterized by an adventuristic response due to a collective overconfidence when the situation is perceived as an opportunity to achieve a great success" (ibid.: 135)
Questions / Criticism
An obvious methodological critique may be to point out that especially the case studies are engaging in selecting on the dependent variable. Then again, Janis (1972, as cited in ibid: 116) suggested his antecedents only as necessary not sufficient conditions for groupthink and poor decision making, which may justify selecting only those cases where the latter actually happened. It seems however interesting to investigate what exactly are the conditions under which despite of given antecedents, decision making does not deteriorate. Some of what is discussed in the research agenda seems to be geared towards these questions.
Janis later (1982, as cited in ibid: 122) introduction of high stress from external threats as another antecedent seems somewhat problematic; this may be only restatement of the cognitive miser (Fiske 1992) hypothesis; after all, reliance on any kind of heuristic is always more likely when people face strained cognitive resources.
I do not see Callaway et al.'s (1985, as cited in ibid: 132) findings that groupthink conditioned group have higher levels of state anxiety as very problematic in terms of Janis (1972, as cited in ibid: 116) original hypotheses that groups move to groupthink to reduce the stress and cognitive load of critical inquiry. It could very well be that groups try to reduce stress by resorting to groupthink conditions - but no anxiety reduction is actually achieved.

abstract = {People's subjective images of class and class conflict reflect a mixture of both materialist forces and the vivid subjective images of equality and consensus among family, friends, and coworkers. These reference group processes distort perceptions of class: They make most people think they are middle class, thereby weakening the link between objective class and subjective perceptions of class and class conflict, fostering consensual rather than conflictual views of class relations, and attenuating the links between class and politics, particularly in Central European nations. Maximum-likelihood analyses of large, representative national samples from six Western democracies support the argument.},

   * Cite first and second welfare theorem, on efficiency and equity. Efficiency should be maximized by law, tax is the place for redistribution
   * [ ] might want to follow-up on Kaplow and Shavell who do this kind of work.

        
ibid. draw n Kahnemann and Tversky behavioral economics, aka 

        
Note that cognitive psych, and even prospect theory is but a pretty feeble attempt to fit the data. Will have to wait for real, maybe evolutionary psych theory. In the meantime, I don't care.

        

        
   * Taxes in Dollar vs. Percent Terms
   * People prefer taxes that aren't called taxes but "fees" or aka social contributions
   * Transparent burden or not
   * Nature and Level of public provision
Bottom line: heuristics and baises will make taxes inefficient, and less redistributive than people wold prefer in the abstract.(47)

        
49: "This is fifth, finally, and perhaps most disturbingly: a skilled politician or political
party can manipulate public opinion and get a public finance system in place in conflict
with prevalent democratic preferences."

        

        
49f: She might first choose hidden taxes, with a regressive incidence,
and raise money through a series of relatively flat surcharges not labeled as taxes. People
would support these, and a surplus might even result. Larger surpluses might follow from
selective “privatization” of government goods and services, reducing the need for taxes.
Cuts could then be made to the most salient tax alone—the income tax—which tax could
be brought to reflect moderate progressivity, even as its importance in the overall budget
declined. Indeed, the politician could take this a step further, and separate out the topics of
50
tax and spending cuts, cutting taxes—again, the income tax—now, postponing spending
cuts until later. The resulting deficit would curtail government growth, and could lead to
replacement taxes less progressive than the initial baseline. And so on: we would wake up
one day with a smaller government, less dependent on the single remaining progressive
tax system, and that tax system would continue to have only moderate levels of progressivity.
Over all, the series of steps would lead to dramatically less redistribution than the
people themselves wanted, at the outset, and the cumulative changes would also fail to
meet the basic paretian constraint.

        
Earmarking, as they suggest (52) to break the disaggregation bias, I think is NOT the solution. First, not all stuff can be earmarked. Second, most earmarked taxes tend to be proportional or regressive. Third, there's a constitutional norm against that in Germany to avoid clientelism.

        
ibid. (53f) seem to be initially skeptical as to whether people can learn. But they think so in the context of (rationally ignorant) voting (!) 
It is hard to expect that ordinary citizens, consumed enough with far
more pressing matters, can or will become expert, consistent decisionmakers on complex
economics subjects. More hope might lie, indeed, in better voting procedures.59

        
I agree, you need to cover some abstractions (54). This will be key in designing the deliberative poll. There'll need to be a class in the beginning, not just a paper, not just discussion groups. First, we need a class.
Economics is complicated because it takes everything into account.
It overcomes focusing by looking at indirect effects and hidden effects. But it also simplifies
by integrating. Often the simplification is striking. Simple principles like “conservation of
money” (analogous, perhaps to conservation of mass in Newtonian physics) can make
public policy seem easier to understand, not harder. For example, such a principle would
lead to immediate questions about how tax cuts will be covered, who will pay after privatization,
and so on. It is not hard to learn that free lunches are rare. Why isn’t economics a
requirement for high-school graduation?60

        
They also suggest that tax design could be outsourced to an agency, arguing that there could be expertise there, without legislators micromanaging the tax code.

        

        
Yes, bingo: 65 Our hope is that, in the long run, better understanding of the
imperfections of democratic government can bring it closer to perfection, as we can see no
other alternative to democracy itself.

annote = {interesting thought: in a socialist economy, polity and economy were the same. This becomes a bit of a problem as soon as that is no longer the case: there is no history of thinking about interactions between these two systems when they are indepdendent (this is taxation). it's never easy to do.  "tight coupling of the conomic and political sphere" is ibid:35
        
"No clear demarcation line separated the state budget, state-owned enterprises and the central bank" (36)
        
policymakers did not have "to rely on taxes and subsidies in order to pursue their allocative and distributive goals." (37). "Alternatively, they could produce the desired results by fixing prices administratively. (37).
        
"Partly because of this limited tax consciousness, there was little popular discontent with the communist tax system" (40). This is an interesting idea: maybe there is a relationship between how much people interact with taxation; tells us something about the endeogeneity of tax preferences.
        
Much of the revenue (43) came from corporate taxes, which of course made a lot of sense: it's kind of like setting arbitrary costs for natural monopolies to redistribute .the usual problems of corporate income taxation do not apply when there is no supply and demand.
Income taxes, let alone progressive ones, were very low. This is interesting: under state socialism, these countries approximated a poll tax world. Maintaining a poll tax in a market economy with free wages and capital incomes is a bad idea.
        
Tell this story of continuity of regimes and understandings.
        
just a  footnote: not including demographic developments, pollution, co2e, etc. is actually an "off-budget fiscal activity" (49).
        
Basically, they did copy/paste from the West: VAT cum CIT/PIT
        
The EU together with the IMF were the drivers (conditionality, etc.) of fiscal mainstreaming (55)},

abstract = {Although it appears that income and subjective well-being correlate in within-country studies (Diener, 1984), a debate has focused on whether this relationship is relative (Easterlin, 1974) or absolute (Veenhoven, 1988, 1991). The absolute argument advanced by Veenhoven states that income helps individuals meet certain universal needs and therefore that income, at least at lower levels, is a cause of subjective well-being. The relativity argument is based on the idea that the impact of income or other resources depends on changeable standards such as those derived from expectancies, habituation levels, and social comparisons. Two studies which empirically examine these positions are presented: one based on 18 032 college studies in 39 countries, and one based on 10 year longitudinal data in a probability sample of 4 942 American adults. Modest but significant correlations were found in the U.S. between income and well-being, but the cross-country correlations were larger. No evidence for the influence of relative standards on income was found: (1) Income change did not produce effects beyond the effect of income level per se, (2) African-Americans and the poorly educated did not derive greater happiness from specific levels of income, (3) Income produced the same levels of happiness in poorer and richer areas of the U.S., and (4) Affluence correlated with subjective well-being both across countries and within the U.S. Income appeared to produce lesser increases in subjective well-being at higher income levels in the U.S., but this pattern was not evident across countries. Conceptual and empirical questions about the universal needs position are noted. Suggestions for further explorations of the relativistic position are offered.},

My beef with this is the following: I think health care should be understood in the context of broader inequalities. It is both dependent and independent variable of more broadly defined social inequality. If we consider social inequality, then, maybe the question of how much we want to allocate as basic care, and how much to treat as "optional" care is not so self-evident, after all.
        
        
Yes, yes, yes: I couldn't agree more: "Let us abolish the misleading term "social-insurance contribution". To call a spade a spade, this is not an insurance contribution but a specific kind of redistributive tax. (ibid: 191) 
        
        
And also emphaticaly yes: "Let us abolish the misleading distinction whereby employers pay part of the health-care contribution and employees the rest." (ibid: 191)
        
        
Bash Kornai for his liberal bias. Kornai is right in terms of regulatory clarity, but wrong/liberal in terms of equity.
        
  1. really, is health care not a redistributive issue?
  2. really, should the health tax fall as GDP rises? why?
There needs to be some kind of equity outcome, too, maybe:
  1. is the macroeconomic budget large enough to reach the point of diminishing returns in fighting the social gradient of bad health?
  2. does it maximize well-being, or quality of life rather than life years?
  3. does it fight, or at least not contribute to existing self-reinforcing dynamics of social inequality?
For my taste, Kornai has naturalized the state of austerity far too much. His regulatory insights are correct; but his allocative sentiment is not. We don't have to save that much. We have to wonder: can't we put more money into this?

Seven types of values are identified, structured along three polar dimensions: Conservatism versus Intellectual and Affective Autonomy; Hierarchy versus Egalitarianism; and Mastery versus Harmony. Based on their cultural value priorities, nations are arrayed in a two-dimensional space, revealing meaningful groupings of culturally related nations. Analyses replicate with both urban teachers of grades 3-12 and college student samples. Implications of national differences in cultural values for differences in meaning of work are explicated. To stimulate research on cultural values and work, hypotheses are developed regarding the cultural value emphases that are especially compatible or conflicting with work centrality, with different societal norms about work, and with the pursuit of four types of work values or goals.

   * my point: no, classes is wrong. But progression and equal opportunity: YES. This is the point of network effects and other dynamics of inequality.
   * make sure to comment here that of course, sometimes, trade elevates classes. the question is that of the counterfactual.
        
        
   * Note: infant industry original by Mill Principles of Political Economy 1970, then later retracted and challenged by Irwin 1996
   * The critique of hyperglobalization is wrong: no one says that states are the solution; but self-interested states in the absence of global governance are impotent, and yes, that IS a tragedy of the commons (244)
   * And again, stupid, stupid, stupid, it iS SPENDING! And that is WRONG! Think Fig. 9.4 on p. 249: here, for once, it shows social tarnsfers as a percentage of GDP; now that makes more sense. But even there: it should control for inequality (!), and the question that we really need to answer is: can the state counteract the governing dynamics as it wishes to? Granted, even transfers as a percentage of GDP is stagnating or even increasing.
   * The right answer would be: test how gini coefficients develop
   * my hunch on inequality outcomes is: they become more polarized WITHIN countries and BETWEEN. and both these questions can only be solved TOGETHER.

abstract = {The article discusses the aspect of social inequality and stratification theory in an attempt to show the relationship between stratification and the rest of the social order. Starting from the proposition that no society is ''classless,'' or unstratified, an effort is made to explain, in functional terms, the universal necessity which calls forth stratification in any social system. Next, an attempt is made to explain the roughly uniform distribution of prestige and income as between the major types of positions in every society. Two questions are of importance in this context; how certain individuals get into their relative positions, and why different positions and social groups carry different degrees of prestige, particularly with regard to the ease or difficulty of mobility between strata. The first question is logically prior and important. The answer is that a competitive system often gives greater importance to the motivation to achieve positions, whereas a non-competitive system gives perhaps greater importance to the motivation to perform duties of positions.},

abstract = {'Second age of modernity' is a magical password that is meant to open the doors to new conceptual landscapes. The whole world of nation sovereignty is fading away - including the 'container theory of society' on which most of the sociology of the first age of modernity is based upon. In this article I propose a distinction between 'simple globalization' and 'reflexive cosmopolitization'. In the paradigm of the first age of modernity, simple globalization is interpreted within the territorial compass of state and politics, society and culture. This involves an additive, not substitutive, conception of globalization as indicated for example by 'interconnectedness'. In the paradigm of the second age of modernity globalization changes not only the relations between and beyond national states and societies, but also the inner quality of the social and political itself which is indicated by more or less reflexive cosmopolitization as an institutionalized learning process - and its enemies.

annote = {   * horrible language
   * doesn't seem to understand that at the most basic political-economy abstraction, PAYGO and private pension funds aren't that different. Demographic shrinking costs, either way.
   * Notably the percentage of pension benefits in GDP is invariant to the pension system (ibid on page 68 is wrong)
   * There are true distributive choices that you can take of course, that are cleverly disguised in funded systems:
      * abolish the indexation of benefits, which under PAYGO is usually on the rate of wage increases
      * don't do early retirement any more (this was a misuse of the system to begin with)
      * strengthen contribution basis, not rights/status-maintenance or income basis
   * avoidance strategies are likewise, effective in both systems to the extent that you don't institute income basis. actually by virtue of being flat, private pensions make create even more avoidance. (ibid is wrong on page 71)
   * the key problem of pensions, PAYGO and public alike is that: the externality of not having children is never priced in, as the father of the german system actually indended.
   * cite Adenauer "Kinder kriegen die Leute immer" und "was interessiert mich mein Geschw\"{a}tz von gestern" to make this fun.
   * comment on risk in financial markets and how pension funds need to be carefully regulated
   * The regulation is difficult. Ibid kind of gives it away when he says that "PPFs may not own derivates, except for hedging purposes." (ibid 75), which of course is a contradiction in terms.
   * participation in growth is always somehow included, either through productivity gains and/or through price indexation.
   * think hard about what either of those two systems is: it's always a promise to future productivity.

Here's a good thought: low spending may also reflect effective policies of full employment (20).

        
I think decommodification stinks: is this really a goal we can accept?

        
The little redistributive impact (27) of the corporatist Welfare State is a big problem.

        
Interesting (if very sad) is Esping-Andersens' pessimism concerning change (32): middle classes have, through past welfare state experiences "cemented" preferences. In the Nordic/Social-Democratic regime, they expect high, universal benefits. In the Conservative/Corporatist it's "divide and conquer", the middle class wants to protect status differences. In the North Atlantic/Liberal model, the middle classes are used to market benefits.

annote = {In meinem Beitrag \"{u}ber “Framing, the bottleneck of constructing legitimate institutions” (2000. Journal of European Public Policy 7 (4): 513-531) habe ich am Beispiel der damaligen EU Verfassungsdiskussion analysiert unter welchen Bedingungen „(1) framing will thrive, (2) particular frames will prevail over competing ones and (3) become a common focus of discussion and contribute to consensus formation in a complex multilateral setting.” Meine These war: “A concept has to be ‚present’ and has to be promising in terms of procedural benefits. Second, framing as a process of discrimination between frames may be triggered for heuristic reasons. (The heuristic chosen is ‘prototype matching’) (.\ldots) instead of a systematic gathering and processing of all available information, shortcuts are most welcome. Such shortcuts are (1) a parsimonious cognitive model, (2) a reminder of positive experience, (3) a link to internalised categories of traditional thinking, and (4) an indication that experts and opinion leaders share the concept. An institutional model that combines well known features of the national systems of democracy will be taken up more easily than complex constructions of ‘associate’ or ‘deliberate’ democracy.“ Obwohl dies eine Erg\"{a}nzung zum Text Daviter w\"{a}re, schlage ich den Artikel nicht zur Lekt\"{u}re vor, weil er schwer zu lesen ist.},

abstract = {Using data on 697 individuals from 375 rural low income households in India, we test expectations on the effects of relative income and conspicuous consumption on subjective well-being. The results of the multi-level regression analyses show that individuals who spent more on conspicuous consumption report lower levels of subjective well-being. Surprisingly an individual's relative income position does not affect feelings of well-being. Motivated by positional concerns, people do not passively accept their relative rank but instead consume conspicuous goods to keep up with the Joneses. Conspicuous consumption always comes at the account of the consumption of basic needs. Our analyses point at a positional treadmill effect of the consumption of status goods.},

annote = {Reading: Deaux 2007, Brown \& Bean 2006, Brown 2007 In the following, I engage Deaux’s (2006) argument on the socio-psychological (?) determinants of successful immigration. First of all, I find a social-psychological perspective very helpful and refreshing. Through looking at the individual-level processes we get to understand much more of what happens on the streets in terms of immigration. For example, her suggestions for determinants of negative immigration attitudes are very insightful: perceived economic threats, an appreciation of diversity and beliefs in status hierarchies are cited as likely reasons. These are precisely the kind of factors and processes that a constructivist (rather than groupist) understanding of immigration renders accessible. Social Psychology, to a large extent, is the discipline that can best explain the boundary processes that Alba and Nee (2003) discuss.  However, I believe that Deaux’s analyses may in one part be falling for the quintessential constructivist fallacy, that is, where constructivism degrades into simple relativism. Deaux does so when she implicitly treats all forms of diversity and appreciation thereof as equally positive for immigration. In reality, there may however be substantively very different expressions of diversity that give rise to either appreciation or rejection, and depending on the “substance of diversity”, these cannot be regarded as all the same. For example, a fundamental rejection of illiberal practices as one expression of diversity (say, forced marriage) may mean something else in terms of appreciation of immigrants and immigration than the rejection of newcomers on racist grounds. In fact, a cases could be construed where rejection of a certain expression of diversity (say, a caste system of social hierarchy, applied only to co-ethnics) may in fact show an increased concern about the well-being of immigrants (those of “lower” castes), rather then ignorance or rejection of immigrants and immigration. Deaux unfortunately does not address these messy and often “non-pc” issues of diversity. The badly need to be addressed, however. },

abstract = {Fresh data sources on cross-national income are examined to document recent changes in the composition of world income inequality within and between nations. New evidence shows that during the 1980s and 1990s the composition of world income inequality experienced a fundamental change, characterized by the diminishing significance of between-nation income differences and the growing prominence of within-nation inequalities. Two competing trends account for this change: (1) steady growth in the average level of income inequality within nations, and (2) a decline in income inequality between nations. These recent trends signify a reversal in one of the major legacies of the Industrial Revolution--the internationalization of world income inequality across national borders. The findings raise important questions for future studies of cross-national inequality and development. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Human beings exhibit substantial interpersonal trust-even with strangers. The neuroactive hormone oxytocin facilitates social recognition in animals, and we examine if oxytocin is related to trustworthiness between humans. This paper reports the results of an experiment to test this hypothesis, where trust and trustworthiness are measured using the sequential anonymous "trust game" with monetary payoffs. We find that oxytocin levels are higher in subjects who receive a monetary transfer that reflects an intention of trust relative to an unintentional monetary transfer of the same amount. In addition, higher oxytocin levels are associated with trustworthy behavior (the reciprocation of trust). Absent intentionality, both the oxytocin and behavioral responses are extinguished. We conclude that perceptions of intentions of trust affect levels of circulating oxytocin.},

annote = {Beck/Grande seem to be not so much analysing the 2nd modernity, a s misconstruing the 1st modernity, if they miss some of the key mechanisms of the political economy (they talk of "Wirtschafstordnungen) that CANNOT coexist in diversity. (29) There may be no political order BETWEEN intergouvernmentalism and federalism, as they want europe to be (81). It's wishful thinking.
Beck/Grande concede on 91 that it is the goal of empire to create security and welfare.
Ok, I get this idea on 91: the empire does the job of the state by extending its boundaries, causing it's own problems (re-read p. 91). But still, isn't this just restating the question? (aha, ok, cf. roman empire\ldots). But there's something else at stake here: we are no longer pre-modern. We are modern. T
Beck/Grande are also right that the state is the political system that has survived, none other. But they argue, times have gotten rough for the state. They might be right about that. But does that mean we have to define into existence a new state?
Beck/Grande have their "states are internally homogenous" thing wrong. STates never were, and if they were, that was a construct (Gellner). if anything, THAT is methodological nationalism. Also, again, the state is modern, and modern institutions don't depend on internal homogeneity.
Similarly to Swank, I'm not sure in how fare Beck/Grade are actually pessimistic as to what the state can still do, rather than what it should do. I think they're just finding a comfortable niche not to engage the normative problems that are out there.
http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulrich\_Beck
Maybe part of the bigger answer is, indeed, a Kerneuropa, and yes, an external bounrady (112), because it MUST be a state.
Beck/Grande forget, maybe intentionally about the great good that a nation state can deliver, about the unique compromise between freedom, growth and redistribution that it forged. They seem to have forgotten, or neglected that. I don't get it, either way.
There's a huge bingo point on this; on pate 113 Beck/Grande talk of an emancipatory and despotic Europe. I think we're getting the despotic kind. Yes! Don;t give up on this point; re-read the footnote.
The problem with Beck/Grande is that they're doing a magic trick: they say: the state will disappear, and something else (e.g. civil society, wtf, page 341) will replace it. That is not convincing AT ALL. They still seem to agree that what the state used to do is still necessary (marktkorrigierend!). Oddly B/G seem to agree that there is a democratic deficit, because the european level doesn't have the same powers that the state used to have. But they don't draw the conclusions.

abstract = {The object of this study was to determine whether the magnitude of educational health inequalities varies between European countries with different welfare regimes. The data source is based on the first and second wave of the European Social Survey. The first health indicator describes people's mental and physical health in general, while the second reports cases of any limiting longstanding illness. Educational inequalities in health were measured as the difference in health between people with an average number of years of education and people whose educational years lay one standard deviation below the national average. Moreover, South European welfare regimes had the largest health inequalities, while countries with Bismarckian welfare regimes tended to demonstrate the smallest. Although the other welfare regimes ranked relatively close to each other, the Scandinavian welfare regimes were placed less favourably than the Anglo-Saxon and East European. Thus, this study shows an evident patterning of magnitudes of health inequalities according to features of European welfare regimes. Although the greater distribution of welfare benefits within the Scandinavian countries are likely to have a protective effect for disadvantaged cities in these countries, other factors such as relative deprivation and class-patterned health behaviours might be acting to widen health inequalities.},

Reading: Alba \& Nee 2003 (Ch. 7), Bean \& Stevens 2003  (5), Brubaker 2001, Telles \& Ortiz 2008.
        
In the following, I take issue with the „ethnic disadvantage model“ as described, amongst others, in Bean \& Stevens (2003).
The ethnic disadvantage model basically holds that „lingering discrimination and structural and institutional barriers to equal access to employment opportunities constitute obstacles to complete assimilation“ (98). It is obvious that in the pre-civil rights era, this view was empirically justified, analytically adequate and critically insightful. With criticizing this perspective in the following I do not at all mean to belittle such discrimination, as well as structural and institutional barriers, that have brought incredible strains and injustice on ethnic groups in the past and, albeit, I would argue, to a lesser extent, continue to do so today. In that respect, the ethnic disadvantage model, or, more broadly speaking, “ethnic-aware” perspectives will continue to be relevant for critical analyses for probably decades to come.
In my mind, the question however stands whether this perspective is still the best one to criticize what is happening to immigrants in the here and now. I would suggest that a much broader critique of persisting patterns of social inequality and lack of social mobility serves much better to understand the current situation. 
The civil rights movements have initiated (through a struggle over several decades) a slew of legislative reforms, outlawing most kinds of blatant discrimination, from education to employment and housing while at the same time pioneering significant programs for affirmative action (although these are surely not as universal as the anti-discrimination legislation). Still, we find that there are ethnic disadvantages. I would suggest that we can best understand these as resulting in a path-dependent manner from previous blatant discrimination. In the absence of those causes of ethnic disadvantages, we can today best investigate them by asking how this path-dependency works, and, in a more critical vein, how it can be broken. Clearly, the answer lies in studies on social inequality and social mobility – perspectives that we can (and should, for reasons of analytical neatness) pursue without including ethnicity in any way. 
Following such a more broadly critical perspective allows us to resolve some of the puzzles that led to the formulation of the ethnic disadvantage model. In fact, such a “social inequality / social mobility” perspective is now perfectly compatible with the assimilation model, there is not even a need for a “segmented” assimilation. One way of looking at it would be to simply say that immigrants are assimilated into the economic underclass of the receiving society and, for reasons that analyses of social mobility have to reveal, continue to stay there for generations (just as some members of the receiving society are). “Ethnicizing” this analyses will help little, it is, so to speak just confusing correlation (ethnic markers and disadvantage) with the true causation (past disadvantage and current disadvantage).
It generally strikes me as very conspicuous that much of the debates on social inequality seem to center around group markers, typically race and ethnicity, gender, and recently (and, in my mind, most esoterically) on sexual orientation. Again, it is not my intention to belittle the (economic) disadvantages experienced in the past and today by these groups. The question stands, however, whether we are really being critical enough in our inquiry when social equality is thereby implicitly defined as the absence of systematic differences between these groups. For once, as argued in the above, we are unlikely to accurately identity the true causes for persisting economic disadvantages by concentrating on these group markers, as blatant discrimination is largely a thing of the past. More importantly, though, the question for me stands whether by concentrating on such a negative definition of social justice (absence of group-based discrimination) we may not implicitly subscribe to a neoliberal ideology that clouds the bigger picture here: persisting patterns of social inequality and increasing social immobility. That, I believe, is what social scientists should criticize, and not settle for little “pet” inequalities.

Turns out I have a problem with “Welfare State”. “To enable all citizens to participate in the mainstream of social and economic life.” (YES!). To “the traditional ambition of providing adequate social protection for those who cannot participate actively, or who have reached the age of retirement, is entirely preserved.” (NO!). This is again, sort of decommodification (deactivating), and also, it is minimal, for the very instance of “cannot participate actively” is but an outcome of a broader redistributive state. (Both of this is Foreword ix, in Esping-Andersen 2002)
        
-         “More generally, mechanisms in the current social systems that discourage people from being active should be discarded as much as possible.” (x Foreword)-         We don’t want a passive welfare state.
-         “Increasing dependency is no law of nature but the result of socio-economic changes, which in turn react to human intervention.” (x Foreword)
-         and they say it, too: “promoting labour market participation is no substitute for income redistribution and the fight against poverty: more work does not necessarily mean less poverty” (xi Foreword)
-         Include (single) parenthood and lack of skills as risks, too (foreword xiii)? Not sure. Lack of skills is not just an individual risk.
-         I think we should keep the risks out of the redistributive issue. Risk is an insurance issue.
        
“The irony (of structural transformation and existing welfare programmes) is that class may be less visible, but its importance is arguably far more decisive. (\ldots) The post-war welfare state no doubt succeeded in equalizing living conditions, but it failed to deliver on its promise of disconnecting opportunities from social origins and inherited handicaps.” (ibid: 3)-         This I like, a lot: “(\ldots) there is a very good argument that equality of opportunities and life chances is becoming sine qua non for efficiency as well.”
        
-         “de-familialization” is an ugly word, but necessary nonetheless.},

abstract = {Material aspirations are initially fairly similar among income groups; consequently more income brings greater happiness. Over the life cycle, however, aspirations grow along with income, and undercut the favourable effect of income growth on happiness, although the cross-sectional happiness-income difference persists. People think they were less happy in the past and will be happier in the future, because they project current aspirations to be the same throughout the life cycle, while income grows. But since aspirations actually grow along with income, experienced happiness is systematically different from projected happiness. Consequently, choices turn out to be based on false expectations.},

@book{AlbaNee-2003-aa,

annote = {        Reading Critique 2        
Reading: Alba \& Nee 2003 (Ch. 2), Milton 1964 (51-54, Ch. 3),  Shibutani \& Kwan 1965 (Ch. 2, 20), Tilly 1990.
        
In the following, I concentrate on the continued analytical and theoretical usefulness of “assimilation” as Alba and Nee (2003) define and refine it in Chapter 2. 
The first important distinction here is that assimilation has incorrectly been equated with convergence towards the mainstream (what Brubaker (2001) calls transitive assimilation), rather then, more accurately, a process increasing similarity involving changes both in the host society and the immigrant (groups).
I find very insightful, though conspicuously under-elaborated that Alba and Nee’s assertion that the Chicago School view of groups was a constructivist one, where groups gain salience merely because they serve well as cognitive heuristics (the social world would be too difficult to grasp, otherwise). This constructivist view, it seems to me, may help innovate the concept of assimilation and resolve some of its problems. This “loose end” is unfortunately not picked up by Alba and Nee. For example, it would have been interesting to further think about what a constructivist view of immigrant (and host society) groups means for boundary processes, in particular boundary blurring. Alba and Nee’s treatment of boundary blurring, a process, by which, they argue, “stable, ongoing and even vital social relationships are routinely maintained across boundaries without diminishing ethnic distinctions” (2003: 62) seems to be somewhat contradictory in terms. The lack of a constructivist perspective on boundary processes shows its shortcomings here: by not paying attention to the socially constructed nature, Alba and Nee cannot enable us to understand the very relationship between the boundaries themselves and the processes that happen in relation to these boundaries (shifting, blurring, crossing). It is however particularly this relationship that needs explaining.
Alba and Nee report the very unsettling finding that “social psychologists and population ecologists have observed that increasing contact (e.g., competition) can even produce a heightened sense of difference between groups” (2003: 62), but they still go on to conclude that “the key (\ldots) (to assimilation) lies in the substantial equal-status contact between members of different groups that is produced on a substantial scale by the socioeconomic and residential opportunities available to many members of the new groups (\ldots) (2003: 62). This conclusion certainly inspires hope, and the direction of their recommendation seems to be correct: increased contact. However, the above cited findings of social psychology require a more disaggregated, constructivist view of interactions and boundary processes as they happen from the perspective of smaller units of analyses (individuals, families). Some of the questions that need to be addressed are: how can communication (in the broadest sense) beyond “boundaries” be moderated to make it successful, that is, to challenge the social relevance of the boundary? In particular, what can be done to prevent likely objectively existing differences (in education, income, for example) and possible associated negative or alienating experiences between the “groups” to precipitate into increasing strength of boundaries and potentially essentializing trends?   
        
Alba, R. D. and V. Nee (2003). Remaking the American Mainstream - Assimilation and Contemporary Immigration. Cambridge, Mass., Harvard University Press. Reading for: Immigrant Incorporation                  
Chapter 2: Assimilation Theory, Old and Neworiginal Chicago school definition of assimilation is not about mainstreaming, but more about mixingspatial assimilation is intimately tied to social assimilation: "social relations are ... inevitable correlated with spatial relations; physical distances ... are, or seem to be, indexes of social distances" (Park as cited in here: 21).Early 20th century immigrants tended to move to ghettos first, then ethnic neighborhoods (2nd generation) and then suburbia (3rd generation)The Canonical Synthesis (largely Gordon 1964, as cited in here: 23ff.)First analytically useful operationalization of what is assimilationAssimilation is a multidimensional concept          
Acculturation is typically the first and often inevitable stageadoption of cultural patterns of the host society, not only language, but also dress, core values, emotional expressions and life goals
in Gordon's terms, largely towards WASP, which he saw as the "core culture"
intrinsic traits"vital ingredients of the group's cultural heritage" (Gorden 1964 as cited in here: 24)extrinsic traits"which tend to be products of the historical vicissitudes of the group's adjustment to the local environment" (Gordon 1964 as cited in here: 24)
Extrinsic traits are surrendered more easilyAcculturation can occur in the absence of all other forms of assimilationStructural assimilation, that is, integration into primary groupsonce it happens, "all of the other types of assimilation will naturally follow" (Gordon 1964 as cited in here: 24).marital
identity
prejudice
discrimination
civic
Again, basic notion that assimilation will converge to WASP-America, except for very few minor modification in "food" and "street names".
Gordon's bottom line; since acculturation happens relatively easily, what we see in the United States is           structural pluralism                not cultural pluralismthe US is constituted from ethnic sub-societies, in whose institutions and social networks most individuals spend the major portion of their social lives
note that this is nothing but a reformulation that class is now modified by race/ethnicity, sort of (need to rethink this).
        A Return to the Chicago School's Roots (largely Shibutani \& Kwan 1964, as cited in here: 30ff)
        The following builds, in part, on 
        Park's (a Chicago founder) theory of race relations cyclestage 1: contactstage 2: competitionstage 3: accommodation
if 3 fails, stage 4: assimilationMead's symbolic interactionism
Darwin's evolutionary theory as extended by human ecogolists        
Shibutani \& Kwan used case studies as empirical basis for their work
Basic assumption: groups are social constructions, based on cognitive heuristics (the world would be too complicated otherwise). Genetic difference, if existent at all, are negligible.
Shibutani \& Kwan note that there is nothing self-evident about increasing social mobility, they point out in fact that ethnic niches and counter-cultural attitudes could exist into the indefinite future.They stress the importance of macro-economic disruptions, particularly technological innovation, for the increased social mobility of these groups and changes in the status quoNew Assimilation TheoryConceptual frameworkis based on institutional analysis"Institutional theories evolved out of two distinct traditions, the methodological individualism of Max Weber's comparative institutional analysis, and methodoloigal holism, stemming from the influence of the French sociologist Emile durkheim, which asserts that institutional structures cannot be reduced to the action of individuals" (35f.)
"Institutions, defined as a web of interrelated norms, formal and informal, govern social relationships" (36).
Formal norms or rules are enacted by formal organizations such as the state
informal norms or rules such as customs, conventions and social norms change involves a more bottom-up evolutionary process of cultural and social change. Informal constraints are often impossible or hard to be changed through formal organizations only, such as the state.Individual behavior is not adequately explained by mere rational choice (maximization of rewards) but instead, (new institutionalism view of behavior) by           bounded                 rationality, people use rule-of-thumb heuristics in the face of too much, too little or incoherent information and incorporate institutional context in their decisions
"Context-bound rationality focuses analytic attention on integrating accounts of choices made by individuals with an analysis of the institutional context" (37).
"Thin" (neoclassical) rationality
"depends on an abstract account of goals motivated by a self-interest rooted in utility or preferences and posits utility maximization as the mode of reasoning for actors who calculate costs and benefits of alternative courses of action in selecting the most efficient means to an end." (37)"Thick" rationality"a context-bound rationality views agency as stemming from choices made by actors according to perceptions of costs and benefits embedded in the institutional environment. It assumes limited cognitive ability on the part of actors and interprets rationality partly as a product of institutional processes." (38)Mechanisms of Assimilation          Proximate                 causes operate at the "individual and social network (primary-group and community) levels and are shaped by the forms of capital that individuals and groups possess" (38)                      
Distal                causes, "often deeper causes, which are embedded in large structures such as the institutional arrangements of the state, firm, and labor market" (38)
Assimilation is not uniform or self-evident; that would precisely assume away what is to be explained
Assimilation occurs through deliberate decisions of individuals as well as through unintended consequences of everyday decisions (38)
Purposive actionmay or may not be based on fully-informed rational-choice type maximization. 
Can also occur in situations of incomplete or distorted information
may be shaped by cultural expectations (as opposed to mere individualized maximized utility)Network mechanisms... "are the social processes that monitor and enforce norms within close-knit groups." (42)
essentially, modes of collective action, how they work and to which ends (the latter being a cause in the stricter sense)
also noted is the self-reinforcing and potentially dysfunctional dynamic of network mechanisms, such as in the reinforcement of in- vs. outgroup dynamics through highly segregated interaction (as in ethnic niches)Forms of capitaldiffers a lot, both within and between groups
Material capitalusually cash (example: South Koreans sell their upper-middle class belongings before emigrating, consequently allowing them to start businesses in the US)Human capitalSouth-east Indians; dark skin color, but often highly-educated, find jobs in Silicon Valley et al.Social capitalmost important capital (and most significant, usually little to no material and little human capital) for Mexican migrants to find employers
including potentially abusive, exploitative relationships
note that social capital in general includes the risk of being tied to ethnic niches, network dependency increasesInstitutional mechanismsconcerned with the structure of incentives embedded in institutions
        
can motivate behavior independently of the other causes
example: it is individually (boundedly) rational to sustain even an oppositional sub-culture, because that sustains a group of which one is a member, even at the cost of an education or whatever it may beImplications for the new immigrationAssimilation and BoundariesHow are (ethnic) boundaries created, and, more importantly, changed?do markets make it worse?
or better? (Weber)three boundary processes;boundary shiftingAsians are white ?
boundary blurring"Stable, ongoing, and even vital social relationships are routinely maintained across boundaries without diminishing ethnic distinctions" (62)
This, I take issue with. Does this even make sense? Can you maintain the ethnic distinction while blurring the boundary? If so, probably only in a social-construction-aware-mode; ethnicity (symbolic) as a game, that might work
Also this requires a lot of thinking on what kind of ethnic practices or beliefs are compatible, and which ones are not (need to rephrase this more carefully and more pc)people constantly not blowing their nose for example, that might be an Asian thing that annoys the shit out of me.
Cleanliness, another one
Those might, at first sight, be not very important and arguably nothing where assimilation is necessary - then again, maybe they do have substantive meaning (respect, consideration), that we might have to address
"Social psychologists and population ecologists have observed that increasing contact (e.g., competition) can even produce a heightened sense of difference between groups." (62). 
interesting!
Jacobs experience, mmh?"The key, we believe, lies in the substained equal-status contact between the members of different groups that is produced on a a substantial scale by the socioeconomic and residential opportunities available to many members of the new groups - supported by institutional mechanisms enforcing equal rights." (62)
"As such interactions proceed on a substantial scale, boundaries can indeed become blurred. Individuals on either side of a boundary can see that the differences between them are less than they previously thought." (63)nah, this process needs to be moderated; communication (non-violent et al.) needs to be carefully promoted to reduce misunderstandings.
Note, in particular, how the lack on any of the above-mentioned causes for assimilation, if they are not yet met, may disable any possibilities for reduced perception of differences. The quintessential issue of ethnicity remains, that, if people meet inspite of differences, say, in education, they may project these differences on ethnicity. Such encounters are unlikely to be successful (affirmative action, in particularly busing provides a good example)
Should be interesting to talk more about this non-pc, messy part of intercultural communication. Another example: people talking extremely loud.
boundary crossingdress, speech, surgery to take on WASP or whatever it may be
... hard to disentangle
bottom line: this theory is much better then the straight- or even bumpy-line theories before; it takes into account the multidimensional, institutionally modified and both individual- and collectivist nature of assimilation, and renders accessible all of the possible interactions.

need for intervention!Generally, I am not too happy with the methodological and analytical groupism displayed in this writing; while this might be historically accurate (or is it?) it bears the danger of naturalizing groups, rather then deconstructing them and identifying the group-entrepreneurship behind it all.
        Chapter 4: Was Assimilation Contingent on Specific Historical Conditions?
The Distinctiveness of the New ImmigrationAbsence of a Foreseeable Hiatus in Immigration
Assumptions that the current wave of immigration (21st century) is sui generis are widespread - but Albert and Nee doubt it (125)Then again, if immigration to the US continues at current levels and from current sources (note how same source countries matter!), the majority of immigrants will continue to be 2nd and 1st generation for some time to come, which means different conditions from the European immigration experience (129)Racial Distinctiveness of New Immigrant GroupsIt was often argued, cite Alba \& Nee (131), that European Immigrants were easier to assimilate because of a more similar cultural and racial heritage. While this may be apparent for skin color, it can always be argued, that really it worked the other way around: hindsight bias.
Asians provide a good counter-examplecited here: (131): high intermarriage, but for women only (!)Irish competed with African Americans in the 19th century, to become "white"; employing ingroup/outgroup mechanisms against "blackness"Impact of Economic Restructuring on Second-Generation mobilitythe argument goes, there need to be innovation (so-and-so-cycles) to increase social mobility especially of second generation. Maybe today, IT and electronics for Indians / Asians?
problem would be, if right now, there is an hourglass economy (that is where social inequality rant comes in) - but do we? Alba and Nee doubt it (136)
        
Hourglass economy is bad because we need a big middle class to facilitate social mobility
They do point out that racism "is manifested today mainly in informal constraints rather than in formal rules as it was in the past." (136)
Great depression: danger of "reactive identities" (140)Changes in the Ideological Climate Regarding Ethnic and Cultural Diversitypoint out a potential problem with multicultural ideology / approvement of bilingualism: it is not explained how the majority culture(s) would have any incentive to learn the minority cultures, too ... so there seems to be an inherent one-sidedness, in that it's always the immigrants who changethis is missing the point the the natives already have a culture ... but still, it's correct that it is going to be one-sided - but I don't see a problem with that.Glazer 1975 (The American ethnic pattern) is cited (143): "ethnic difference is acceptable so long as it is voluntary and confined to private spheres of family and community; the public sphere, especially ist political sector, require a common, English-language-based culture"I agree
cite that one author who mentioned that politics are always in the vernacularturns out, the multiculturalist regime of Canada leads to similar outcomes in terms of assimilation as is the US regime (144)...
Legitimation of Racial/Ethnic Categories by the Stateit is pointed out that some ethnic niches were reinforced by control of union locals et al, leading, for example, to construction in NYC being dominated by Irish and Italians in the 20th century, a practice, that, whether based on tacit or formal over rules, will "fortify (...) ethnic identities" (156)bad!Competing Models of Ethnic IncorporationAlba \& Nee prefer a constructivist understaning of ethnicity, race being a subcategory of ethnicity (I like that)putative belief stuff: Max Weber's definiton, "whose core is the notion that an ethnic group involves a "we-they" distinction where "we" are defined, in "our" own eyes and those of others, on the basis of a belief in shared ancestry or point of origin (whether the belief is true or not)bottom line: Alba \& Nee think that those pointing out differences between current and previous waves of immigration are "reading history backwards" (166)
        Chapter 5: The Background to Contemporary ImmigrationRead, but no notes.
        Chapter 6: Evidence of Contemporary Assimilation
Acculturation and Language Assimilationpoints out that the Sikhs (relatively successful, second generation moves from farming communities into college-educated jobs wherever) will have problems with "maintaining and ethnic cultural base" (218). "The concept of selective acculturation may also underestimate the seductiveness of American culture and, in particular, of the individualism and materialism that permeate American life. In any case, the forms of social control available to parents in bounded immigrant communities can be expected to attentuate with successive generation, if the experiences of the earlier immigrations from Europe, East Asia and Central America are any indication" (218)so, what?
isn't that ok, since it is based on individual free decisions (as opposed to "social control")?cite Portes and Rubmau who "point out that bilingual individuals possess two (or more) symbols for every object and that, accordingly, bilingualism is conducive to intellectual flexibility; they also present evidence that it contributes to success in American schools (intervening variable ?!?). For positive outcomes to be attained, however, bilingualism must not pose a barrier to mastery of the majroity language; it must, in other words, be "fluent" as opposed to "limited", bilingualism" 
I agree
this could be seen as a metaphor what symbolic, chosen and multiple ethnic identities (we already have them anyway; mother, teacher, woman what have you) and how beneficial that could be!
make bilingualism and respective cultural repertoires a "game", too: encourage cases (that will, admitteldy, be relatively few) where non-ethnics speak Spanish too and learn the other culture (more than tex-mex, cite Lily and Lio).
this will be relatively rare, to be fair, because of the associated costs - but still, it would help, just as gay/lesbians help break the essentialized view on genderAlba and Nee (226) are very pessimistic about chances of Spanish being the majority language in any state anytime soon - they think that English will prevail, alarmist movements of "english only" are over the topthey provide a slew of evidence for the perseverance of english and attentuation of old language (227)Alba and Nee note that language group size (and proximity) may be determinants of how long it takes until the original language is gone (228), example Asians (many languages) and Hispanics (one language)Socioeconomic AttainmentDistinction between "traditional labor immigrants and human-capital immigrants" (230)More on reactive, oppositional identity"Even more threatening are the seductions of an "oppositional" identity, which scorns the drudgery (and uncertainties) of school success for the more instantaneous respect afforded by low-achieving, defiant peer groups" (240)...
                  
Social Relationshere we go:  Asiam American females were more likely to intermarry than males (263)also: "the decline in racian endogamy over the decade was highest among men and women with high educational attainment" (265)goes to underscore: it's inequality and social mobility, not race and whatever anymoreChapter 7: Conclusion - Remaking the Mainstream"in arguing for the importance of assimilation as a social process, we are not asserting its inevitability, as the early writing on assimilation appeared to." (273)The Contingencies of Assimilation1) human-capital or labor migration2) is the economy open for the second generation upward mobility? (is there a restructuring?)
3) what is the impact of racism?
4) legal status
there will be divergent outcomes
Incentives matter (277): "insofar as entry into the mainstream expands the structure of opportunities ranging from education, occupation, and areas of residence to greater latitude in variety of private choices, many immigrants and their children are likely to consider courses of action that, whether intended to do so or not, improve their probability of assimilating".my note: change the "ethnic" game (Brubaker) of ethnic entrepreneurs on all side to change the incentives
Happy Christmas should be ok in the game view
Forced assimilation doesn't work (282), aside from normative concernsRemaking the Mainstreamthe "no majority" population scenario, Alba \& Nee think, will be undermined by assimilationI like that

Assimilation theory redux, indeed: "Just as assimilation theories may sometimes risk"assimilationist" bents (i.e., they may presume [or even advocate] uni-directional immigrant movements toward Anglo-
American culture and behavior that imply optimistic portraits of the immigrant experience), so too non-assimilationist theories risk "exclusionist" inclinations (i.e., they may presume impenetrable and unchanging cultural and structural differences that invite overly pessimistic portraits). " (405)yes, I agree, but they might have gone further to deconstruct and de-essentialize identity
symbolic ethnicity is viewed as an indicator in favor of assimilation theoryactually, symbolic ethnicity, I would maintain, shows as a phenomenon and possibility that the current framework needs overhaul (assimilation theory, still, after all, assumes an identity and culture-link, which needs to be changed)Alba and Nee promote institutions and say they're important for assimilation, and I agreeeducation
and again, essentialized views of ethnicity, race and even cultureMassey 2004Massey, D. S. (2004). "Review: Remaking the American Mainstream - Assimilation and Contemporary Immigration." Contemporary Sociology 33(4): 408-410. Very nice review, read, but no comments.},

abstract = {Maslow's hierarchy-of-needs theory is used to predict development of Quality of Life (QOL) in countries over time. Previous data sets have not had sufficient power to test these development trends among countries. Therefore a new database was developed that includes annual quality of life time-series for 88 countries from 1960 to 1994, covering measures on all five of Maslow's need-levels. Results showed significant agreement with some of Maslow's predictions, including his sequence of need achievement, and parts of an S-shaped trajectory in QOL. However, his mechanism of growth - that countries must slow growth in one area to increase growth in another - was disconfirmed.},

abstract = {Human society has changed greatly,over the past centuries and this process of ''modernization'' has profoundly affected the lives of individuals; currently we live quite different lives from those our forefathers lived only five generations ago. There are differences of opinion as to whether we live better now than before and consequently there is also disagreement as to whether we should continue modernizing or rather try to slow the process down. Quality of life in a society can be measured by how long and happy its inhabitants live. Using these indicators I assessed whether societal modernization has made life better or worse. First, I examined some findings from present day survey research. Istarted with a cross-sectional analysis of 90 nations and found that people live longer and happier in today's most modern societies. Second, I examined trends in 10 modern nations over the lst 30 years and found that happiness and longevity have increased in most cases. Third, I considered the long-term and review findings from historical and comparative anthropology, which show that we lived better in the early hunter-gatherer society than in the later agrarian society. Together these data suggest that societal evolution has worked out differently for me quality of human life, first negatively, in thechange from a hunter-gatherer existence to agriculture, and next positively, in the more recent transformation from an agrarian to an industrial society. We live now longer and happier than ever},

Highlightsour tax system is a disgrace, and has been so for decades. The way we tax is complicated, inefficient, and unfair. Yet whenever elected officials in Washington actually try to do something about tax, they tinker at best. At worst, they make the system even more annoying. We need fundamental, comprehensive tax reform, not ad hoc tinkering. Two, there is a widening gap between the rich and the not-rich in this country. It may surprise many readers to learn that there is a deep connection between these two facts. Tax as it is today is a cause of the wealth gap. Tax as it could be tomorrow would narrow it.

Heirs would simply take over the decedent's built-in gain and would pay tax only if and when they sold their inheritance. But even the possibility of a carryover basis on death is unpopular: citizens complain that it would be a record-keeping nightmare, for example, because few could figure out the basis that their parents or grandparents had in their assets. Former president Jimmy Carter considered enacting a carryover-basis-on-death rule, but it was a political nightmare; the rule never became law. The tax law has another answer. It imposes an estate tax on the net wealth of certain decedents' estates, a tax that aims in part to get the rich to pay some tax. Although this so-called death tax is not a very effective or sensible tax, lawmakers considered it a sufficient response to the built-in gain issue. And so they allowed the income tax to ignore built-in gain on death. Cash or property received by bequest is not taxable income to the recipient, and the inherited assets get a stepped-up basis under the income tax for all future purposes. The built-in gain simply disappears in the heirs' hands. The stepped-up basis for assets acquired at the time of death is a key part of Tax Planning 101, a set of basic planning techniques that enables wealthy people to live well tax free.

Lower interest rates help us all, as politicians found out when the economy boomed after we began to cut down our national debt in the 1990s. The beneficiaries of increased saving include, importantly, workers, because lower interest rates encourage more investment in labor-saving technology and leave more social product available to be paid out in wages. Lower interest rates also help consumers, who can pay less for their home mortgages and credit card debts, and students, who will not have to pay as much interest on their student loans.

But a problem arises when people have fun on the job. What should we do about pleasurable events-golf outings, three-martini lunches-that occur in the course of doing business? The basic principle of the Fair Not Flat Tax is that consumption-personal spending-ought to be taxable. It wouldn't be fair if some taxpayers could get their fun at the workplace, with nontaxed dollars, while others had to do so away from work, with taxed ones. This raises a host of difficult issues. But once again, they are no different from ones we have long faced under the income tax, which is also supposed to include personal consumption in the tax base.

cite PDPA as small-scale deliberation

        
Habermas, on the other hand seems to argue that deliberators can't get into the business of government anyway.

        
"communicative action, is action oriented to reaching understanding" (Habermas 1996, Norms and Facts)

        
Social coordination through communicative action is possible, Habermas
argues, in societies characterized by ‘strong archaic institutions’ and ‘small and
relatively undifferentiated groups’ (Habermas, 1996, p. 25). This is because communicative
action always takes place against the backdrop of a shared lifeworld,
which in traditional societies provides ‘a reservoir of taken for granteds, of unshaken
convictions that participants in communication draw upon in cooperative
processes of interpretation’ and from which ‘processes of reaching understanding
get shaped’ (Habermas, 1987, pp. 124 and 125, respectively).

        

        
However, coordination
through communicative action becomes improbable in post-traditional
societies, due to the emergence (strictly related to rationalization and modernity)
of self-centred action based on strategic calculations. In these societies, ‘in which
unfettered communicative action can neither unload nor seriously bear the
burden of social integration falling to it’ (Habermas, 1996, p. 37), law emerges
as a functional necessity exactly to ‘lighten the tasks of social integration for
actors whose capacities for reaching understanding are overtaxed’ (Habermas,
1996, p. 34).

It should be noted that some of the discourses
which are produced in the informal public sphere conform poorly to the ‘gentlemen’s
club’ model featured in some theories of deliberation (i.e. rational, poised

Explain how the following (ibid: 17) is incorrect: The supporters of pension privatizations have emphasized, for
example, the fact that funded schemes would be able to: 1) ensure higher gains through
private investments; 2) interrupt the vicious circle of current workers forced to pay for current
pensioners; 3) guarantee a better linkage between contributions paid and benefits received;
and 4) make additional money available for the markets (see World Bank 1994; or several
recommendations present in numerous OECD economic surveys).

abstract = {A new middle class has emerged, composed of persons who have achieved affluence and secure status in occupations oriented to intellectual and cultural work. Families in this stratum rear children with values and character structures which are at some variance with the dominant culture. Such youth are especially sensitized to social questions, are repelled by acquisitive and nationalistic values, and strive for a vocational situation which maximizes autonomy and self-expression. This sector of the youth population has been the primary constituency for the American student movement of the 1960's. Although the situation of these youth differs from that found in other countries with significant student movements, there are important resemblances between the two. A comparative analysis of student movements suggests that their emergence is a precursor of major qualitative societal and cultural change.},

annote = {Two countries (Latvia and Poland) have already reacted to this 'demographic
wave' in the pension reform debate and have .introduced the first
pillar as a defmed contribution system, where the sum of all contributions
paid in are converted into an annuity. This means that the average life expectancy
at retirement age is a decisive factor for the amount of monthly
pension payment. Adaptations to a changing demographic framework are
automatically included in the pension formula, so that the additional burden
of rising life expectancy will not be carried by the current working population
through higher contribution rates - as in a defined benefit system - but
will lead directly to lower pension payments, so that the entire burden is carried
by the pensioners themselves.I5
The impact of the demographic setting
(this is ibid: 70)
        
And again it falls considerably short on any systematic understanding of demographic change. AGING and SHRINKING are to distinct phenomena.
        
The literature doesn't go nearly deeply enough to render visible the systemic choices that are out there. It naturalizes them.

Chapter 1: Immigration's Nuances and Complexities
9/11 attacks called into question the current immigration regime
The Questions Addressed by This Book
How many and what kinds of persons migrate to the United States?
What happens to immigrants after they arrive?
What effects do immigrants have on persons already living in the United States?
What are the overarching implications of immigration for the United States?
Chapter 2: Migration Flows, Theories and Contexts
Theories of Migration Causes
Neoclassical Economic Theory
Migration is caused my macro-level disequilibria between the supply and demand of labor. 

        
On the individual level, microeconomic considerations, balancing costs and rewards, cause people to migrate.
New Economic Theories of Migration
also, increased social inequality and lessened social mobility in the sending countries can cause migration
focus on remittances and effects on local communities "migration-induced multiplier effects" (Taylor 1992 as cited in here)

        
household economic theory
Labor-Market Segmentation Theory
Primary labor market: basic demand production with capital-intensive, high-paying jobs.
Secondary labor market: fluctuating or seasonal demand with labor-intensive, low-paying jobs.
Barriers between these two markets limit social mobility of immigrants, who are often willing to take on secondary labor market jobs.
Segmentation can also revolve around gender, ethnicity or nativity, sometimes with self-reinforcing effects (an employer hires an immigrant from a certain group and depending on that employees performance will hire more or less (moving up the queue) from that group).
Ethnic employment or ethnic niches can further increase segmentation (such as construction, domestics ..., other typically "immigrant" jobs).
World Systems Theory
migration is an outflow of the overall relationships among countries, and among regions and cities within countries
heavily influenced by dependency critique of capitalism
Network Theory
"cumulative causation" (33) et al.
Political Economy Theories
Chapter 3: Mexico and Unauthorized Migration

        

        
Chapter 4: Immigrant Welfare Receipt - Implications for Policy

        

        
Chapter 5: The New Immigrants and Theories of Incorporation
Assimiliation has always meant a two-way process; immigrants affect the receiving society as much as vice versa (Alba and Nee 2003 as cited in 94).
Theoretical Models and the Issue of Changing Incorporation
The Assimiliation Model
"Immigrants gradually begin to absorb and influence the cultural values and norms of the majority society" (97).
Assimilation stages (Gordon 1964 as cited in 97)

        
Cultural assimilation (including linguistic)
Structural assimilation (educational, occupational, labor market (wages, earnings, employment)
Marital assimilation
Identificational assimilation
The Ethnic Disadvantage Model
(some observers view ethnic attachment as positive)
Bottom line: "increasing knowledge of the language of the new country and familiarity with its culture and customs often do not lead to increasing structural assimilation" (98)
"Lingering discrimination and structural and institutional barriers to equal access to employment opportunities constitute obstacles to complete assimilation" (98)
Often, because the economic position is initially viewed as relatively to the situation in the sending country, these persisting disadvantages are noticed only by the second or third generations.
The Segmented Assimilation Model

        
persisting disadvantages do not negate the assimilation model; only in so far as it might be more of a "bumpy road" (99), rather than a straight line.
... suggests that different immigrants may be affected differently by assimilation, depending (in part) on their position on the labor market and education, with some of them making it, others being marginalized (and, possibly, reverting to oppositional behaviors and attitudes).
Existing Theory and Its Discontents
Arguments against assimilation theory (cultural incorporation is inevitable and necessary for structural incorporation)
African Americans, despite few cultural differences (?) failed to incorporated structurally, even after legal obstacles were lifted in the 1960s.

        
"European groups continued to manifest aspects of ethnic distinctiveness despite their substantial structural incorporation" (105)
even though this might have been symbolic ethnicity, an option that African Americans don't really have.

        
This contributed to the development of an ethnic pluralist perspective of incorporation
This essentially multicultural perspective, however, while "tolerating" and "celebrating diversity" also "preserved the boundaries among groups" (105), thereby essentializing the
A New Model of Changing Contingency Between Economic and Sociocultural Incorporation
It seems likely that new immigrants "may not follow the trajectories implied by the old models" (106) for European immigrants.
The US is no longer a biracial society with a small black minority; rather, it is multiethnic and multiracial today
Bottom line: "If cultural accomodation facilitated structural incorporation in the past, this has not seemed apparent or necessary for today's newcomers" (107)
Ethnic boundaries may become less constrained and "more flexible and dynamic than emphasized by either the straight-line or ethnic-pluralist models" (107).
results may include: more multiracial identifications among Asian and Latino immigrants, more intermarriage (107)
This may be so simply because the native-born population is now less likely to constrain immigrants and require assimilation.
Maybe, contemporary immigrants are so diverse and large that racial and ethnic boundaries become more negotiable than in previous waves of immigration, where within-group variation was typically small (European groups of immigrants tended to be homogeneous).
How to people self-define them?
Reactive ethnicity
arises from repeated discrimination, hardening of ethnicity, possibly oppositional attitudes

        
Symbolic ethnicity
amongst those persons who are largely incorporated, both culturally and economically, ethnicity is merely for individualistic and expressive needs (108).

        
Selective ethnicity
develops amongst those with better status and chances; they choose ethnic ties for rational reasons (ethnic niches), some discrimination might continue (108)
Ethnicity and socio-economic incorporation may follow a curvilinear relationship; with those being lowest and highest in the economic stratification having the highest degree of ethnic identification, albeit in a very different way

again, defending assimilation: “assimilation means convergence of newcomer and host groups, with each affecting the other.” (Bean \& Stevens, somewhere)
I think this is still in the essentialized framework, and more significantly, confusing identity, culture and the group that claims the former
"Bean and Stevens contend, however, that assimilation is mostly a matter of time, probably needing an extra generation or two." (872)
this is huge; not to be neglected, Keynes applies: in the long run, we're all dead anyways.

"Bean and Stevens illustrate that the growing nativity gap in welfare receipt results largely from two types of aggregation bias: immigrants' welfare use is higher when households rather than families are used for the comparisons, and when various types of means-tested transfers, such as AFDC, SSI, and forms of cash assistance, are combined to compute the rates. That ideology often generates very different policy recommendations from the same findings makes strong scientific evidence all the more important." (770)

"No mans is an Island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main."
(John Donne, MEditation XVII)

        
the spirit level points out (176pp) that it is NOT public spending or service provision that matters - but post-tax income inequality.

        
Joseph und seine br\"{u}der

        
some problems change their social gradient (180 spirit level)

        
It's not just that the people at the lower end benefit from more equality (that's cricularly true of course), "but across whole populations, rates of mental illness are five times higher in the most unequal compared to the least unequal societies. Similarly, in more unequal societies people are five times as likely to be imprisoned, six times as likely to be clinically obese and murder rates may be many times higher. The reason why these differences are so big is, quite simply, because the effects of inequality are not confined just to the least well-off: instead they affect the majority of the population."

        
They show this for cronic disease, mortality, infant mortality

        
"Inequality acted like a pollutant spread throughout society" (spirit level 184, footnote 319)

        
just how it acts like a pollutant is unclear. I can only guess and think about that book (Fall Steinmann) I read; maybe there is something about the higher stratification that lingers on in social life. Maybe there is a universal truth in Joseph and his brothers.

        
note for the collapse of eastern europen communism the effects this had on income distribution, health and other outcomes, citing the spirit level (188).

        
Key point on reverse causality is on page 189: it's unlikely that all of the indicators are same, and it's unlikely that homicide rates would affect inequality

        
outrageous examples:
- Indian children from lower castes solved mazes just as well as those from higher castes - until their low caste was made known. (spirit level 191)

        
There is a very broad point to make to that the welfare of the deprived depends on more than just their inferior access to material resoruces. This is chapter 3 spirit level. Amongst others, similarly fit Macaques (either all high or all low status from different groups) put into new groups, the ly inferior ones (in that new pecking order) developed more abdominal fat and more arteriosclerosis and used more cocaine. (192)

"But perhaps Hobbes missed an important part of the story. As well as potential for conflict, human beings have a unique potential to be each other's best source of cooperation, learning, love and assistance of every kind." (spirit level 198)},

funnily enough, he reports intense "collective protest" in the early post-communist period (Ekiert and Kubik 1999 as cited in ibid: 3)

        
 Alternative explanations:

        
  1. corporatist institutions
  2. militant union competition
  3. (economic theory of) strikes are very difficult in conditions of economic downturn and high unemployment
  4. individual exit, rather than voice
  5. post-communist legacy, bad name for working class action.
Says ibid (15), tripartite institutions have been weak (more mean words on 15).

        
statements notwithstanding, the majority of the studies of post-communist corporatism
have found these institutions to be rather weak and ineffective. Indeed, the language
used is often quite strong: corporatism in the region has been described as “paternalist”
(Tatur, 1995), “illusory” (Ost, 2000), and a “sham” (Rutland). Rather than leading to
social democratic outcomes, the process has been described as “fragile tripartism subordinate
to neo-liberal dictates” (Pollert, 1999: 165) and a “political shell for a neo-liberal economic
strategy” (Thirkell, Petkov and Vickerstaff, 1998: 166).14

        

        
Comment on this when arguing that the fiscal side of equality is important. Tripartism failed.

        
Yes, there is a lot of difference within the post-communist countries, and reasons 1-4 may serve to explain this says ibid. 25.

        
But what also needs explaining (and what may be more important) is what they have in common, vis a vis latin america, for example. "This is all the more compelling when we recall that more than a decade after the end of communism, the political end economic landscape in the region is quite diverse." (iid: 26\_

        
Bringing about the end of communism, trade unionists were "schizophrenic" (referring to Czech unionists, Pollert 2001: 23 as cited in ibid: 28).

        
unions are also the least trusted of civil society institutions (30 ibid).

A Primer on Alternatives in Tax

        
"A progressive postpaid consumption tax emerges as the fairest and least arbitrary of all comprehensive tax systems, precisely because it chooses to make its decisions about the appropriate level of progressivity at the right time. In doing so, it burdens some but not all uses of capital and its yield, and for normatively attractive reasons."
     Edward J. McCaffery (2005: 812).

        
   * There are three types of taxes
      * Income taxes (including capital incomes)
      * Prepaid consumption taxes (VAT), or, equivalently, payroll taxes, or, equivalently social contributions (such as statutory health insurance, unemployment insurance, pensions, etc. in Germany)
      * Postpaid, progressive consumption taxes ("The Perfect Tax"), based on a cash flow account of spending (Consumption = Income - Savings / aka Haig-Simons definition of income).
   * There are two savings norms (as in: what exactly is saving?)
      * Ordinary Savings Norm: saving is just postponed consumption, "smoothed out" over the lifetime. Nominal interest is just a compensation for postponement (think: inflation, risk, growth, discounting of the future). Incomes from savings (= capital incomes) should not be taxed.
      * Yield-to-Capital Norm: incomes from savings are a genuine accretion to wealth. Interest is income.  Incomes from savings (= capital incomes) should be taxed.
      * Note: 
         * Income taxes (if complete) adopt a yield-to-capital norm. All capital incomes are (ideally) taxed. (In reality, as McCafferty explained, they hardly ever are, because there are systemic flaws, such as "tax evasion 101")
         * Prepaid consumption taxes (or VAT, or payroll, or social contributions) adopt an ordinary savings norm. No capital incomes are taxed.
         * Postpaid progressive consumption taxes (or spending taxes, or cash flow based consumption taxes) tax some capital incomes. To the extent that (dis!)saving is used to smooth out consumption, interest is not taxed. To the extent that it is used to enhance lifestyle, or for lumpy consumption (opposite of smoothed out), it is taxed.
   * For a review of different taxes and how they work, consider my prospectus (again attached), pages 60-66
   * Consider this example to understand that a VAT (German MwSt.) is the same as a proportional payroll or proportional social contribution.

        
The Detective Story of Income Taxation (Who Dunnit? Who killed progressivity?)

        
"The real and pressingly practical question for tax is not whether to have an income or a consumption tax, but what form of consumption tax to have. The stakes in this battle are clear and dramatic: the fate of progressivity in tax lies in the balance."
     Edward J. McCaffery (2005: 817)

        
"Advocates of redistributive taxes must wake up and realize that their end is in jeopardy on account of their poor choice of means: they are fighting, and losing, the wrong war."
     Edward J. McCaffery (2005: 848)

        

        
   * The political alternatives now seem to be between progressive income tax and prepaid proportional/flat consumption tax (VAT, Social Contributions, Payroll, all equivalent). This is an incomplete choice set.
   * The one progressive component of today's tax regimes, the personal income tax, has deficient backstops.
      * Estate and gift taxes (buy, borrow, die)
      * Corporate income tax (indeterminate incidence, no progression, indeterminate location of value generation)
   * The personal income tax as structural flaws, remaking the PIT ever more into a wage or prepaid consumption tax.
      * Macomber. Tax on accession/accrual or tax on realization? The Supreme Court rules: you can tax only on realization (selling).
         * this problem is much exacerbated in the case of income in illiquid assets.
      * Tax Planning 101 aka Buy, Borrow, Die. Mrs Macomber could simply borrow on her (appreciating!) stock as collateral. Recall that borrowing, is not income under an income tax. Mrs Macomber can spend out of the borrowing tax-free.
      * Heirs never pay the estate tax, because that is (as it makes sense) a net tax on assets minus liabilities. In the extreme case of Tax Planning 101, there is no estate.
      * Also, Tax Planning 101 incentivizes people to never realize, to never sell. This may lead to markets freezing up and asset as well as derivatives (!) bubbles, at great cost to the economy.
A Numerical Example to Show the Equivalence of VAT and Payroll

        
   * 2 Periods
   * EUR 100 Income
   * 20\% tax
   * 10\% interest

        
Payroll / Social Contributions

        
   * EUR 100 Gross * 0.8 Payroll Tax = EUR 80 Net
PeriodConsumptionSavingp1EUR 40EUR 40p2EUR 44 (from Saving * 1.1)0Aggregate Consumption / Utility = EUR 84

        

        
VAT

        
   * EUR 100 Gross = EUR 100 Net
PeriodConsumptionSavingp1EUR 50 * 0.8 = EUR 40EUR 50p2(EUR 50 from Saving * 1.1) * 0.8 = EUR 440
Aggregate Consumption / Utility = EUR 84

        
---

        
Questions, Criticism
   * Will a postpaid consumption tax be sufficient to get at the (self-reinforcing, fractal) dynamics of capital distribution? (Or should it?)
      * Consider that this was, according to McCafferty (2005: 810), one of the reasons to introduce it in the US.
      * Answering this question (normatively) depends crucially on:
         * The empirical dynamics of capital distribution: exactly how do postindustrial markets distribute returns?
         * Is capital concentrated in so few hands by now as to depress growth and innovation? (Innovation is often marred by asymmetric information; to solve it, innovators need to risk their own collateral. If they don't have collateral, they can't innovate.)
         * Do capital owners exercise discretion in their investment? Consequently, does capital ownership bestow power?
         * Has capital accumulation (not distribution!) reached the point of diminishing returns? (This is the question of the optimal savings rate).
            * consider that a savings rate is a commons
            * consider that there may be nominal dissavings (think demographic change, global inequality, global warming)
   * How to relate this to "Social Integration and the Welfare State"
      * The history
   *

annote = {336: "Seit mehr als 20 Jahren dominiert der von der Marktintegration als Pr\"{a}misse ausgehende TINA-Diskurs (frei nach Thatcher: there is not alternative!).

        
My beef is this: there is nothing per se bad with any of the integration policies that are featured in Ganssmans anrgy and good pictures; it's just that redistributive ability is missing.

        
Gan\ss mann also recognizes the race to the bottom in social regulatory arbitrage and tax competition (338) and agrees that only the EU could solve the problem.

        
He says there's limited evidence (corporate income tax from 40 in 82 to 29 in 2001) for race the bottom. Problem: he doesn't look at unemployment, debt, tax burden on the middle class.

        
But he's right to point out that (339): "Mit wenigen Ausnahmen hat also der (in den Niedernlanden noch nicht einmal) gestiegene Umverteilungsaufwand nicht ausgereicht, um die gr\"{o}\ss ere Ungleichheit der Marketinkommen auszugleichen". That's exactly the point: we don't have the potent polity to redistribute as we see fit.

        
BINGO! He actually has my trilemma on page 341

        
Iversen und Wren!

        
BINGO! 347 "Von den nordischen Erfolgen geht einerseits keine Sogwirkung aus, weil sich bei den relevanten politischen Akteuren offenbar Ignoranz mit kognitiver Verarmung paart>"

        

        
This is the kind of work that ill-serves people. It's confusing the big picture.

   * A 'Welfare State' is a state in which organized power is deliberately used ... in an effort to modify the play of market forces in at least three main directions - first, by guaranteeing individuals and families a minimum income irrespective of the market value of their work or property; second, by narrowing the extent of insecurity by enabling individuals and families to meet certain social contingencies (for example, sickness, old age and unemployment) which lead otherwise to individuals and family crisis; and third, by ensuring that all citizens without distinction of status or class are offered the best standards available in relation to a certain agreed range of social servivces
        
        
   * Point out: welfare state isn't the same as spending.
   * Requiring firmst to do x (by means of regualtion) is also welfare statism
   * Welfare state discussions are flawed w/o taxaton and broader ideas of inequality
   * Welfare state should be defined best in terms of outcomes, equal opportunity
   * Here's what's misunderstood/wrong/misconfigured (Powell et Hewitt 2002: 15)
        
   * "Different bits have been added over the years by different people with different purposes in mind. It is not a single unified, unambiguous entitiy, but rather a ragbag of programmes, only vaguely related and imperfectly integrated."
        
        
   * Be careful with minimal definition
   * Residual services, in fact often become "poor services" for "poor people" (Titmsus 1968: 134 as cited in Powell and hewitt 2002)
   * decommodification is worng, normatively and empirically
   * better way to think about it: move from a measure of decommification to the best balance/ratio/configuration/maximization of efficiency over equity (this is key!)
   * Contrast Beveridge (minimal benefits, freedom from wants, poverty)
   * with ... Marshall (decommidifcation, maximal)

@article{Wilkinson2006,
abstract = {Whether or not the scale of a society's income inequality is a determinant of population health is still regarded as a controversial issue. We decided to review the evidence and see if we could find a consistent interpretation of both the positive and negative findings. We identified 168 analyses in 155 papers reporting research findings on the association between income distribution and population health, and classified them according to how far their findings supported the hypothesis that greater income differences are associated with lower standards of population health. Analyses in which all adjusted associations between greater income equality and higher standards of population health were statistically significant and positive were classified as "wholly supportive"; if none were significant and positive they were classified as "unsupportive"; and if some but not all were significant and supportive they were classified as "partially supportive". Of those classified as either wholly supportive or unsupportive, a large majority (70 per cent) suggest that health is less good in societies where income differences are bigger. There were substantial differences in the proportion of supportive findings according to whether inequality was measured in large or small areas. We suggest that the studies of income inequality are more supportive in large areas because in that context income inequality serves as a measure of the scale of social stratification, or how hierarchical a society is. We suggest three explanations for the unsupportive findings reported by a minority of studies. First, many studies measured inequality in areas too small to reflect the scale of social class differences in a society; second, a number of studies controlled for factors which, rather than being genuine confounders, are likely either to mediate between class and health or to be other reflections of the scale of social stratification; and third, the international relationship was temporarily lost (in all but the youngest age groups) during the decade from the mid-1980s when income differences were widening particularly rapidly in a number of countries. We finish by discussing possible objections to our interpretation of the findings.},

The theory states that the subjective evaluation of life as a whole is influenced by a person's notion of what a happy life is. The theory stresses the importance of heterogeneity; this is: the conceptual referent is not the same for everybody. The paper shows that heterogeneity in the conceptual referent also extends to the relationship between happiness and income. Income is an important explanatory variable for some people, while for others it is completely irrelevant; and this depends on the conceptual referent for happiness a person holds. The existence of heterogeneity in the conceptual referent for happiness and, consequently, in the explanatory structure of happiness has important implications for behavioural economics. Happiness pursuing persons are expected to behave differently if they have different notions of what a happy life is. The empirical analysis is based on a large database from Mexico.

note, as ibid 10 say that European Integration has, so far been understood (in the political science of european studies, dominated by political science) mostly as institutional integration. "Actors are (...) political and administrative elites).
        
        
ibid 13: "G\"{o}ran Therborn (1997) hat einmal pointiert gefragt, ob 'Europa als das Skandinavien der Welt' bezeichnet werden kann und meint damit, ob Europa im Vergleich zu anderen Regionen und Gesellschaften eine \"{a}hnliche Stellung bek\"{a}me wie Skandinavien f\"{u}r Europa - mit spezifischen Institutionen, einer spezifischen Sozialstruktur und spezifischen politischen Leitbildern. (...) Allerdings beschreibt er das Europ\"{a}ische Modell als bis heute einzigartig, was die Kombination aus wirtschaftlichem Erfolg und durch sozialpolitische Innovation gew\"{a}hrleistete soziale Integration angeht." (anders als China, USA, etc.).
        
        
It's really not a neofunctionalism (as cited in ibid 15:, Ernst B. Haas 1968) "der die politische und \"{o}konomische Integration als zentrale Antriebskr\"{a}fte auch einer gesellschaftlichen Integration ansah". It's, so to speak, the neo-dysfunctionalism of economic integration.
        
        
Actually the EU has built more regulative than redistributive interventions.
        
        
        
yes, indeed (ibid: 17): "Der soziologische Betrachter nun vor der Frage, welche gesellschaftlichen Qualit\"{a}ten von Relevanz sind, und wie sie letztlich bestimmbar sind. (...) Gesellschaft ist hierbei nicht selten eine normativ aufgeladene Beziehungskonstellation, umschrieben mit Begriffen wie Vertrauen, Solidarit\"{a}t, Homogenit\"{a}t, Abwesenheit von Konflikten (vgl beispielsweise Offe 2001).
        
Yes, and that's how it should be.
        
        
        
Neo-mittelalterliche Struktur (ibid: 18) ist wirklich problematisch: "Die EU stellt sich so als ein soziales gebilde dar, das neben allen Befestigungstendenzen an seinen R\"{a}ndern 'ausfranst" und sich hinsichtlich seiner Grenzen flexibel zeigt. (...) Vielmehr entwickelt sich eine neo-mittelaalterliche Struktur, welche sich weniger durch zementierte Au\ss engrenzen, Zentralisierung und hierarchische Organisation auszeichnet, sondern durch \"{u}berlappende Autorit\"{a}ten, geteilte Souver\"{a}nit\"{a}t und unscharfe greznen (vgl. Waeve 1997, Zielonka 2001( Dies bedeutet im Vergleich zu nationalstaatlichen Grenzen ein Mehr an Variabilit\"{a}t und weniger Einheit und Homogenit\"{a}t (Bach 2003)".
        
In der Tat! und das ist sehr problematisch! Consider Felix's Core-Periphery stuff for this. It's core-periphery, indeed.

   * reviewing Fishkin: When the People Speak
   * 66: There are, Fishkin notes, “normally strong disincentives for mass public opinion to be very deliberative.” 11 These can range simply from what economists would call the “search costs” involved in becoming suitably informed about public issues to the collective-action problems, also much emphasized by economists, that promote “free-riding” by most of the public on the relatively small number of individuals who are willing to invest their scarce time and energy (and money) into the demands of genuine republican citizenship. Some use these economistic insights to discredit the very project of popular democracy. 12
   * Trilemma
      * Political equality
      * Mass participation
      * deliberation
Fishkin is no utopian. Indeed, a very important part of his argument
is that one must choose among the horns of his trilemma.
There is, therefore, the sad realization that “the fundamental
principles of democracy do not add up to such a single, coherent
ideal to be appropriated, step by step. \ldots Achieving political
equality and participation leads to a thin, plebiscitary democracy
in which deliberation is undermined. Achieving political equality
and deliberation leaves out mass participation. Achieving deliberation
and participation can be achieved for those unequally
motivated and interested, but violates political equality.” 13

        
uh-oh, fishking may be to careful?

        
66: "Rather, the question is whether, in effect,
Fishkin should embrace a more robust version of “deliberative
assemblies” as at least a complement and perhaps, in certain
contexts, a replacement for representative democracy that relies
on elections as a mechanism of selecting decision makers. And,
if he did embrace such a version (and vision), would he find himself
the target of hostility by those who might give him a hearing
if his announced aims are significantly more modest?"$\backslash$

        
in a similar vein, 66f: "One of my favorite political
dicta is John Roche’s emendation of Lord Acton’s famous, adage: “Power corrupts, and the possibility of losing power
corrupts absolutely.” To the$\backslash$

        

        
Get in touch with this guys. He is great. He wants subversive Fishkinians.

        
Comment in my piece that I agree with this guy; we need to argue and engage how this project can engage, complement or replace pluralist/representative democracy. I don't know how to do this yet, and that will stay beyond what is possible in my project.
BUT: tax is a pretty thorny issue. It'll ruffle some feathers. Maybe it's so much at the heart of the representative apparatus that you get to see some ot this stuff.

abstract = {Social Mobility in Europe is the most comprehensive study to date of trends in intergenerational social mobility. It uses data from 11 European countries covering the last 30 years of the twentieth century to analyze differences between countries and changes through time.  The findings call into question several long-standing views about social mobility. We find a growing similarity between countries in their class structures and rates of absolute mobility: in other words, the countries of Europe are now more alike in their flows between class origins and destinations than they were thirty years ago. However, differences between countries in social fluidity (that is, the relative chances, between people of different class origins, of being found in given class destinations) show no reduction and so there is no evidence supporting theories of modernization which predict such convergence. Our results also contradict the long-standing Featherman Jones Hauser hypothesis of a basic similarity in social fluidity in all industrial societies 'with a market economy and a nuclear family system'. There are considerable differences between countries like Israel and Sweden, where societal openness is very marked, and Italy, France, and Germany, where social fluidity rates are low. Similarly, there is a substantial difference between, for example, the Netherlands in the 1970s (which was quite closed) and in the 1990s, when it ranks among the most open societies. Mobility tables reflect many underlying processes and this makes it difficult to explain mobility and fluidity or to provide policy prescriptions. Nevertheless, those countries in which fluidity increased over the last decades of the twentieth century had not only succeeded in reducing class inequalities in educational attainment but had also restricted the degree to which, among people with the same level of education, class background affected their chances of gaining access to better class destinations.},

      * Really nothing could be further from the truth. This is utter crap. It secured the welfare state only in the very short term, at the cost of rising structural unemployment, fiscal crisis and high debt.
   * Yes, indeed, "low income taxation and differentiated income taxation are to some extent economically equivalent". (1060). 
      * There is no big mystery as to why (some) Scandinavian countries managed to keep up relatively high PIT rates, because these were dual PITs. 
      * And also, regressive taxes are superior because "these taxes imply moderate capital income taxation, but the same result can be achieved by differentiating the tax burdens on capital and labor". (1060)
   * Ganghof says, the Danish case results from PR and their specific design of veto players (1063).
      * For this, consider more:
         * Lijphart 1999: 253
         * Huber \& Stephens 2001: 309
         * Swank 2002: 48-51
         * Wilensky 2002
         * Kato 2003
   * Important arguments why regressive taxes are (supposedly) easier to sustain a large public sector: (this is Kato 2003: 51, as cited in ibid).
      * lower visibility
      * earmarking
      * flat rates (actually, proportional)
   * agreed, that "tax structure and tax level are best understood as part of an equilbrium" (Hettich \& Wiener 1999), as cited in ibid.
      * talk more about the equilibrium of structure and level
      * I think: we're at a very low equilibrium
      * also talk more about why the interaction of level and structure is important.

address = {Ithaca, NY},
annote = {note from ibid 208 that in fact retrenchment differs a lot (Hungary), but maybe revenue generation does not.
        
think hardere about the informal sector: is it maybe endogenous to the tax regime?!?
        
        
As ibid notes (230), the acquis features only limited sets of rights (gender and work safety) not broad social rights. (this is specifically about Hungary and Poland)
        
note the importance of the IFIs.
        
231: Since the December
2000 Nice Treaty, the EU has introduced common social indicators
and placed greater emphasis on issues of poverty and social exclusion. Although
these measures may have some epistemic influence, they also are
not legally binding and have no real authority over social policy.
        
        
also note that: not all is bad about EU integration, Ibid notes (231) that accession strengthened democratic institutions and policy making processes. Parliaments got stronger (Kazakhstan can't easily happen).
        
        
EU accession one could assume was a different driver than the welfare state residualism of IFIs. (ibid 228).
        
Make this clear from the beginning: the eu is not all bad. maybe it's not as bad. But it's also not as good as it could be.
        
Maybe the EU is not the elephant in the room, but the IFIs and the story of postcommunist transition.

@book{Kamarck2002,
abstract = {Economics as a Social Science is a highly readable critique of economic theory, based on a wide range of research, that endeavors to restore economics to its proper role as a social science. Contrary to conventional economic theory, which assumes that people have no free will, this book instead bases economics on the realistic assumption that human beings can choose; that we are complex beings affected by emotion, custom, habit, and reason; and that our behavior varies with circumstances and times. It embraces the findings of history, psychology, and other social sciences and the insights from great literature on human behavior as opposed to the rigidity set by mathematical axioms that define how economics is understood and practiced today.Andrew M. Kamarck demonstrates that only rough accuracy is attainable in economic measurement, and that understanding an economy requires knowledge from other disciplines. The canonical hypotheses of economics (perfect rationality, self-interest, equilibrium) are shown to be inadequate (and in the case of "equilibrium" to be counterproductive to understanding the forces that dominate the economy), and more satisfactory assumptions provided. The market is shown to work imperfectly and to require appropriate institutions to perform its function reasonably well. Further, Kamarck argues that self-interest does not always lead to helping the general interest.Economics as a Social Science examines and revises the fundamental assumptions of economics. Because it avoids jargon and explains terms carefully, it will be of interest to economics majors as well as to graduate students of economics and other social sciences, and social scientists working in government and the private sector.Andrew M. Kamarck is former Director, Economic Development Institute, the World Bank.},

Scharpf (31) actually advocates consumption taxation, but he may have it a bit confused. Just moving to consumption tax doesn't help. It depends on which kind. A VAT, proportional consumption tax will actually still burden labor disproportionalte.

        
Scharpf also promotes (31) the negative income tax.

abstract = {Pelkmans ndash; European Integration: Methods and Economic Analysis, Third edition'The bible of European economic integration studies.' Professor Hiromasa Kubo, President of the EU Institute, Kobe University, Japan'This text is very well researched and the author displays an excellent knowledge of the EU both at an institutional level and at an economic analysis level.'Dr Adrian Gourlay, Loughborough University Written by one of Europe's leading EU economic analysts, this third edition of European Integration has been significantly reorganised in structure, fully revised, and updated to reflect the changes in the European Union over recent years.The book offers a fundamental discussion and detailed analysis of European integration. Uniquely, it combines economic analysis with a detailed knowledge of the integration methods employed in the EU. Whilst being academically rigorous and assuming some prior knowledge, it is full of practical examples and case studies, enabling students to bridge the gap between theory and policy practice. Key features Unique integration of economic theory with EU regulatory and policy framework. Non-mathematical treatment of economic theory - which is presented using graphical, non-algebraic tools. Innovative analysis of the economics of subsidiarity, EU regulation, the economic constitution of the Union, services market integration and the EU budget. Numerous case studies and practical examples included throughout. New to the third edition Fully updated - now including a more extensive economic analysis of monetary union, the euro, and monetary and fiscal policy in the eurozone. Updated coverage of the economic and strategic issues of enlargement in the EU-25, soon to be EU-27, and beyond. New chapters on 'The Economics of EU Regulation' and 'Assessing the EU Budget'. Revised and extended treatment of economic cohesion (convergence and divergence) and EU social policy and reforms. Updated coverage of the internal market for network industries and the Bolkestein directive on horizontal liberalisation of services, plus a deeper economic analysis of pro-competitive effects of the single market. Includes new examples on recent issues, and cases that have been revised and deepened analytically. AudienceEuropean Integration is an intermediate level text which has been carefully designed to appeal to a wide range of students studying economic integration as part of an economics, business, law or public administration degree.AuthorJacques Pelkmans is Jan Tinbergen Chair for European Economics and Director of the Department of European Economic Studies at the College of Europe in Bruges. He is also a Council Member of the WRR in The Hague (an independent think-tank, attached to the Prime Minister's office) and Associate Fellow of the Centre for European Policy Studies (CEPS) in Brussels.},

Here's a good thought: low spending may also reflect effective policies of full employment (20).

        
I think decommodification stinks: is this really a goal we can accept?

        
The little redistributive impact (27) of the corporatist Welfare State is a big problem.

        
Interesting (if very sad) is Esping-Andersens' pessimism concerning change (32): middle classes have, through past welfare state experiences "cemented" preferences. In the Nordic/Social-Democratic regime, they expect high, universal benefits. In the Conservative/Corporatist it's "divide and conquer", the middle class wants to protect status differences. In the North Atlantic/Liberal model, the middle classes are used to market benefits.
